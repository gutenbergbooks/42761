<h1><i>FABLES AND FABULISTS</i></h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>DEFINITION OF FABLE.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 11em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Read my little fable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that runs may read.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>: <i>The Flower</i>.</p></div>

</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Byron</span>: <i>The Astrologer</i>.</p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">The</span> term 'fable' is used in two senses, with
two distinctive meanings.</p>

<p>First, as <i>fabul&aelig;</i>, it is employed to denote the
myths or fictions which, by the aid of imagination
and superstition, have clouded, or have become
blended with, the history of the remote past.
Such are the stories related of Scandinavian and
Grecian heroes and gods; beings, some of whom
doubtless had an actual human existence, and
were wise and valiant and powerful, or the reverse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
in their day, but around whose names and
persons have clustered all the marvellous legends
that are to be found in mythological lore. The
better name for these is 'romance.'</p>

<p>Secondly, as <i>fabell&aelig;</i>, it is used to signify a
special branch of literature, in which the imagination
has full play, altogether unassisted by superstition
in any shape or form. The fabulist
confers the powers or gifts of reason and speech
on the humbler subjects over whom he exercises
sway, and so has ample scope for his imaginative
faculty; but there is no attempt on his part at any
serious make-believe in his inventions. On the
contrary, there is a tacit understanding between
him and his hearers and readers, that what he
narrates is only true in the sense of its application
to corresponding circumstances in human life and
conduct.</p>

<p>It is with fable as understood in this latter sense
that we propose to deal.</p>

<p>The Fable or Apologue has been variously defined
by different writers. Mr. Walter Pater,
paraphrasing Plato's definition, says that 'fables
are medicinable lies or fictions, with a provisional
or economized truth in them, set forth under such
terms as simple souls can best receive.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
sophist Aphthonius, taking the same view, defines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the fable as 'a false discourse resembling truth.'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The harshness of both these definitions is scarcely
relieved by their quaintness. To assert that the
fable is a lie or a falsehood does not fairly represent
the fact. A lie is spoken with intent to deceive.
A fable, in its relation, can bear no such construction,
however exaggerated in its terms or fictitious
in its characters. The meanest comprehension is
capable of grasping the humour of the situation it
creates. Even the moral that lurks in the narration
is often clear to minds the most obtuse.
This is at least true of the best fables.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, in his 'Life of Gay,' remarks that
'A fable or epilogue seems to be, in its genuine
state, a narrative in which beings irrational, and
sometimes inanimate&mdash;<i>quod arbores loquantur, non
tantum fer&aelig;</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;are, for the purpose of moral instruction,
feigned to act and speak with human
interests and passions.'</p>

<p>Dodsley says that ''tis the very essence of a
fable to convey some moral or useful truth beneath
the shadow of an allegory.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Boothby defines the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
fable as 'a maxim for the use of common life,
exemplified in a short action, in which the inhabitants
of the visible world are made the moral
agents.' G. Moir Bussey states that 'the object
of the author is to convey some moral truth to the
reader or auditor, without usurping the province
of the professed lecturer or pedant. The lesson
must therefore be conveyed in an agreeable form,
and so that the moralist himself may be as little
prominent as possible.'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Mr. Joseph Jacobs says
that 'the beast fable may be defined as a short
humorous allegorical tale, in which animals act in
such a way as to illustrate a simple moral truth
or inculcate a wise maxim.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>These various definitions or descriptions apply
more especially to the &AElig;sopian fable (and it is
with this that we are dealing at present), which is
<i>par excellence</i> the model of this class of composition.
Steele declares that 'the virtue which we gather
from a fable or an allegory is like the health we
get by hunting, as we are engaged in an agreeable
pursuit that draws us on with pleasure, and makes
us insensible of the fatigues that accompany it.'<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
This is applied to the longer fable or epic, such
as the 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey' of Homer, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
'Faerie Queen' of Spenser, rather than to the
fable as the term is generally understood, otherwise
the simile is somewhat inflated.</p>

<p>One more definition may be attempted:</p>

<p>The &AElig;sopian fable or apologue is a short
story, either fictitious or true, generally fictitious,
calculated to convey instruction, advice or reproof,
in an interesting form, impressing its lesson on the
mind more deeply than a mere didactic piece of
counsel or admonition is capable of doing. We
say a short story, because if the narration is spun
out to a considerable length it ceases to be a true
fable in the ordinary acceptation of the term, and
becomes a tale, such, for example, as a fairy tale.
Now, a fairy or other fanciful tale usually or
invariably contains some romance and much
improbability; it often deals largely in the superstitious,
and it is not necessarily the vehicle for
conveying a moral. The very opposite holds good
of a fable. Although animals are usually the
actors in the fable, there is an air of naturalness
in their assumed speech and actions. The story
may be either highly imaginative or baldly matter-of-fact,
but it never wanders beyond the range of
intuitive (as opposed to actual or natural) experience,
and it always contains a moral. In a word,
a fable is, or ought to be, the very quintessence of
common sense and wise counsel couched in brief
narrative form. It partakes somewhat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
character of a parable, though it can hardly be
described as a parable, because this is more sedate
in character, has human beings as its actors, and
is usually based on an actual occurrence.</p>

<p>Though parables are not fables in the strict
and limited meaning of the term, they bear a
close family relationship to them. Parables may
be defined as stories in allegorical dress. The
Scriptures, both old and new, abound with them.
The most beautiful example in the Old Testament
is that of Nathan and the ewe lamb,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in which
David the King is made his own accuser. This
was a favourite mode of conveying instruction and
reproof employed by our Lord. Christ often
'spake in parables'; and with what feelings of
reverential awe must we regard the parables of
the Gospels, coming as they did from the lips of
our Saviour!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>CHARACTERISTICS OF FABLES.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'To hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to Nature.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>: <i>Hamlet</i>.</p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">There</span> is an archness about the best fables
that creates interest and awakens curiosity;
and it is the quality of such that, whilst simple
enough as stories to be understood and enjoyed
by the young, they are at the same time calculated
to interest, amuse, instruct and admonish
those more advanced in years.</p>

<p>A fable should carry its moral without the telling;
nevertheless the application is often worth
supplying, because it puts, or should put, the
lesson taught by the fable in a terse and impressive
form. Above and beyond all, a fable should
possess the quality of simplicity, and whilst easy
to be understood, it should have force and appropriateness.</p>

<p>Fables treat of the follies and weaknesses, and
also of the nobler qualities, of humankind, generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
through the medium of the lower animals
and the members of the vegetable and natural
kingdom. These are made to represent the
characters we find in human life. Curious, that
although it is chiefly the lower animals and inanimate
things that are made the vehicle of the
instruction or reproof contained in the story, we
do not feel that there is any incongruity in these
having the power of speech. We willingly accept
the circumstance of their faculty of speech and
reasoning as Gospel truth for the time being. It
is natural that they in the fable should speak as
the heroes or actors, and we listen to their words,
whether wise or foolish, with deference or contempt
as the case may be.</p>

<p>It is a question in casuistry how far justice and
injustice are done to the inferior animals and
the members of the vegetable kingdom by this
liberty that is taken with them in the fable. If
they had the knowledge of the fact, and the
power of remonstrance, it may be conceived that
some of them, at least, would repudiate the
characters and propensities which we in our
superior conceit so glibly ascribe to them in the
fable. And, indeed, there is doubtless a good
deal of unfairness in our habit of stigmatizing
this one with cunning, that one with cowardice,
and the other with cruelty, or stupidity, or dishonesty,
as suits our purpose. Possibly if some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the humbler creatures thus branded were
gifted with the power of writing fables for the
benefit of <i>their</i> fellow creatures and associates,
they might be able to point to characteristics in
the higher order of beings which it is desirable to
hold in reprobation, and this, too, with as much
or more reason and justice on their side than we
have on ours. But, in truth, the fabulists themselves
tacitly admit the force of this argument,
inasmuch as the failings and defects and general
qualities which they ascribe to the characters in
the fable are, of course, those of the human
species. A fable of &AElig;sop, <i>The Man and the Lion</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
is very much to the point here:</p>

<p>'Once upon a time a man and a lion were
journeying together, and came at length to high
words which was the braver and stronger of the
two. As the dispute waxed warmer they happened
to pass by, on the road-side, a statue of a
man strangling a lion. "See there," said the
man; "what more undeniable proof can you
have of our superiority than that?" "That,"
said the lion, "is your version of the story; let
us be the sculptors, and for one lion under the
feet of a man, you shall have twenty men under
the paw of a lion!" Men are but sorry witnesses
in their own cause.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>A fable is generally a fiction, as has already
been said. It is a singular paradox, however,
that nothing is truer than a good fable. True to
intuition, true to nature, true to fact. The great
virtue of fables consists in this quality of truthfulness,
and their enduring life and popularity are
corroboration of it. If not true in the sense of
being reasonable, they are nothing, or foolish, and
therefore intolerable. We instinctively feel their
truth, and are encouraged, or amused, or conscience-smitten
by the narration, for they deal
with principles which lie at the very root of our
human nature.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable feature of this species of
composition that a departure from the natural
order of things loses its incongruity in the fable;
and although this view has been controverted,
the argument against it fails to carry conviction
in face of the excellent examples that can be
adduced. By way of illustration, take the fable
of the man and his goose that laid the golden
eggs. We don't remember ever meeting with a
goose of this particular breed out of the fable.
There are numberless geese in the world&mdash;human
and other. But the goose that lays a golden egg
every morning is a <i>rara avis</i>. Nevertheless, she
has a veritable existence in the fable, and we
would as soon think of casting a doubt on our
own identity as on that of the fabled bird. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
story has always been, and will continue to be,
Gospel truth to us, and we never recall it without
commiserating the untimely end of the poor
obliging goose, and thinking, at the same time,
what a goose its owner must have been to kill it
and cut it up, in expectation of finding in its
inside the inexhaustible treasure his impatient
greed had pictured as existing there. <i>Semper
avarus eget.</i> Had <i>we</i> been the fortunate owner
of such an uncommon fowl, one golden egg each
day would have contented us!</p>

<p>Certain early authors, with the formalism which
characterizes their writings, have attempted an
arrangement of fables under three distinct heads
or classes, designating them, respectively, Rational,
Emblematical, and Mixed. The Rational fable is
held to be that in which the actors are either
human beings or the gods of mythology; or, if
beasts, birds, trees, and inanimate objects are
introduced, the former only are the speakers.
The Emblematical fable has animals, members
of the vegetable kingdom, and even inanimate
things for its heroes, and these are accordingly
gifted with the power of speech. The
Mixed fable, as the name implies, is that in which
an association of the two former kinds is to be
found. The distinction, though perfectly accurate,
serves no useful purpose and need not be
observed. As a matter of fact, all fables are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
rational or reasonable from the fabulist's stand-point;
and all are emblematical or typical of
moods, conditions, and possible or actual occurrences
in daily life, whoever and whatever be the
actors and speakers introduced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>THE MORAL AND APPLICATION OF FABLES.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Come, sir, lend it your best ear.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>: <i>Love Freed</i>.</p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">Thus</span> La Fontaine:<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> 'The fable proper is
composed of two parts, of which one may
be termed the body and the other the soul. The
body is the subject-matter of the fable and the
soul is the moral.'</p>

<p>On the origin of the added morals to fables,
Mr. Joseph Jacobs<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> has the following appropriate
remarks: 'The fable is a species of the allegory,
and it seems absurd to give your allegory, and
then give in addition the truth which you wish to
convey. Either your fable makes its point or it
does not. If it does, you need not repeat your
point: if it does not, you need not give your
fable. To add your point is practically to confess
the fear that your fable has not put it with sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
force. Yet this is practically what the
moral does, which has now become part and
parcel of a fable. It was not always so; it does
not occur in the ancient classical fables. That it
is not an organic part of the fable is shown by the
curious fact that so many morals miss the point
of the fables. How then did this artificial product
come to be regarded as an essential part of
the fable? Now, we have seen in the J&#257;takas
what an important <i>r&ocirc;le</i> is played by the <i>g&#257;thas</i> or
moral verses which sum up the whole teaching of
the J&#257;takas. In most cases I have been able to
give the pith of the Birth-stories by merely giving
the <i>g&#257;thas</i>, which are besides the only relics which
are now left to us of the original form of the
J&#257;takas. Is it too bold to suggest that any set of
fables taken from the J&#257;takas or their source
would adopt the <i>g&#257;tha</i> feature, and that the moral
would naturally arise in this way? We find the
moral fully developed in Babrius and Avian, whom
we have seen strong reason for connecting with
Kybises' Libyan fables. We may conclude the
series of conjectures by suggesting that the morals
of fables are an imitation of the <i>g&#257;thas</i> of J&#257;takas
as they passed into the Libyan collection of
Kybises.'</p>

<p>Montaigne remarks that 'most of the fables of
&AElig;sop have diverse senses and meanings, of which
the mythologists chose some one that quadrates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
well to the fable; but for the most part 'tis but
the first face that presents itself and is superficial
only; there yet remain others more vivid, essential
and profound into which they have not been
able to penetrate.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>If this be so, it is an argument against the
common practice of limiting their significance to
the one moral that is often given as an appendage
to the fable. It is worthy of note that &AElig;sop did
not supply, either orally or in writing, the separate
moral to any of his fables. They were left to
speak for themselves and produce their unaided
effect. The moral or application appended to
or introducing a fable (for both practices are
followed), is an innovation, as appears from what
has already been advanced, probably intended to
make clear what was obscure in the apologue.</p>

<p>The true moral is contained in the fable itself.
The application may, and often does, vary with
the idiosyncrasies of the commentator. Besides
the moral and application there is in some
collections of fables what is designated 'The
Remark,' and 'The Reflection,' in which the commentator
tries, as it were, to drive home the
application of the story with an additional blow.
Our own experience as a youth was that all
these appendages to the fable were invariably
skipped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>From all which it would appear that the moral
and the so-called application of a fable are not
one and the same thing. In point of fact, the
latter may and does vary according to the peculiar
views of the commentator. An exemplification of
this may be found in the applications of Sir Roger
L'Estrange and Dr. Samuel Croxall, the latter
taking it upon him to stigmatize in strong language
the twist which he asserted the former gave
to the morals of the fables in his collection.
L'Estrange, who was a Catholic, concerned himself
in helping the restoration of Charles II.,
and was a devoted adherent of his successor,
James, from whom he received place and emoluments.
In publishing his version of &AElig;sop, his
object, as he affirms in his preface, was to influence
the minds of the rising generation, 'who
being as it were mere blank paper, are ready
indifferently for any opinion, good or bad, taking
all upon credit.' Whereupon Croxall observes:
'What poor devils would L'Estrange make of the
children who should be so unfortunate as to read
his book and imbibe his pernicious principles&mdash;principles
coined and suited to promote the growth
and serve the ends of Popery and arbitrary power,'
and more to the same purpose.</p>

<p>The question as to whether the moral or application,
if any is supplied, should be placed at the
beginning or end of a fable has sometimes been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
discussed. On this head Dodsley has some pertinent
remarks that may be quoted. He says: 'It
has been matter of dispute whether the moral is
better introduced at the end or beginning of a
fable. &AElig;sop universally rejected any separate
moral. Those we now find at the close of his
fables were placed there by other hands. Among
the ancients Ph&aelig;drus, and Gay among the
moderns, inserted theirs at the beginning; La
Motte prefers them at the conclusion, and La
Fontaine disposes them indifferently at the beginning
or end, as he sees convenient. If,' he
adds, 'amidst the authority of such great names
I might venture to mention my own opinion, I
should rather prefer them as an introduction than
add them as an appendage. For I would neither
pay my reader nor myself so bad a compliment as
to suppose, after he had read the fable, that he
was not able to discover its meaning. Besides,
when the moral of a fable is not very prominent
and striking, a leading thought at the beginning
puts the reader in a proper track. He knows the
game which he pursues; and, like a beagle on a
warm scent, he follows the sport with alacrity in
proportion to his intelligence. On the other hand,
if he have no previous intimation of the design,
he is puzzled throughout the fable, and cannot
determine upon its merit without the trouble of a
fresh perusal. A ray of light imparted at first may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
show him the tendency and propriety of every expression
as he goes along; but while he travels
in the dark, no wonder if he stumble or mistake
his way.' If it be considered necessary or desirable
to give the moral separately, or to apply
the fable, Dodsley's argument here seems to us to
be incontrovertible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>FABULISTS AS CENSORS.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Mark, now, how a plain tale shall put you down.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>: <i>King Henry IV</i>.</p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">Fabulists</span> as censors have always been
not only tolerated, but patronized and
encouraged, even in the most despotic countries,
and when they have exposed wickedness and
folly in high places with an unsparing hand.
&AElig;sop among the ancients, and Krilof amongst
the moderns, are both striking examples of this.
The fables of antiquity may indeed be truly said
to have been a natural product of the times in
which they were invented. In the early days,
when free speech was a perilous exercise, and
when to declaim against vice and folly was to
court personal risk, the fable was invented, or
resorted to, by the moralist as a circuitous method
of achieving the end he desired to reach&mdash;the
lesson he wished to enforce. The entertainment
afforded by the fable or apologue took off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
keen edge of the reproof; and, whilst the censure
conveyed was not less pointed and severe, the
device of making the humbler creatures the scapegoat
of human weakness or vice mollified its
bitterness. The very indirectness of the fable
had the effect of making the sinner his own
accuser. Whom the cap fitted was at liberty to
don it.</p>

<p>Ph&aelig;drus, in the prologue to his third book,
thus gives his view of the origin and purpose of
fables:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Here something shortly I would teach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fables' origin. To reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The potent criminal, a slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beasts and birds a language gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wishing to strike, and yet afraid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these his instruments he made:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all that dove or lamb might say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against them no indictment lay.'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The fable saves the self-love of the person to
whom it is applicable. It enables him to stand
aside, as it were, and become a spectator of the
effect produced by his own conduct. In this way
he is impressed and humbled without being
affronted. When one, even though guilty, is
openly and directly reproved for a misdeed, the
stigma often raises a rebellious spirit, which either
suggests a hundred justifiable reasons for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
action or begets a defiant mood, driving him to
persist in his evil courses.</p>

<p>Listening to the fable, 'we see nothing of the
satirist, who probes only to heal us, and who does
not exhibit any of the personal spleen and ill-humour
which meet and put us out of countenance
with ourselves and each other in the invectives of
those who sometimes set up for moralists without
the essential qualification of good nature. The
fable gives an agreeable hint of the duties and
relations of life, not a harangue on our want of
sense or decorum. We feel none of the superiority
of the fabulist, who, indeed, generally leaves
us to make the application of his instructive story
in our own way; and if we do sometimes prefer
to apply it to our neighbour's case instead of our
own, we are still improved and amended, inasmuch
as we have learned to despise some vice or
folly which our unassisted judgment might have
regarded more leniently.'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Dodsley, again, puts
the matter finely when he says:<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> 'The reason
why fable has been so much esteemed in all ages
and in all countries, is perhaps owing to the polite
manner in which its maxims are conveyed. The
very article of giving instruction supposes at least
a superiority of wisdom in the adviser&mdash;a circumstance
by no means favourable to the ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
admission of advice. 'Tis the peculiar excellence
of fable to waive this air of superiority; it leaves
the reader to collect the moral, who, by thus
discovering more than is shown him, finds his
principle of self-love gratified, instead of being
disgusted. The attention is either taken off from
the adviser, or, if otherwise, we are at least
flattered by his humility and address. Besides,
instruction, as conveyed by fable, does not only
lay aside its lofty mien and supercilious aspect,
but appears dressed in all the smiles and graces
which can strike the imagination or engage the
passions. It pleases in order to convince, and it
imprints its moral so much the deeper in proportion
that it entertains; so that we may be said to
feel our duties at the very instant we comprehend
them.'</p>

<p>The humour of a good fable is a fine lubricant
to the temper. Sarcasm, irony, even direct
criticism, are in place in the fable, but humour is
its saving grace. Without this it cannot be
classed in the first order. Wanting in this quality,
the fables of some writers who have attempted
them are flat, stale and unprofitable. Humour in
the fable is the gilding of the pill. It is like the
effervescing quality in champagne, the subtle
flavour in old port.</p>

<p>It may be questioned whether a fable has ever
the full immediate effect intended. Men are loath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to apply the moral to their own case, though they
have no difficulty in applying it to the case of
others&mdash;even to their best acquaintances and
friends. For example, take the present company,
the present company of my readers&mdash;it is
usual, by the way, to except 'the present company,'
but we will be rash enough, even at the
risk of castigation, to break the rule&mdash;take, then,
the present company in illustration of our point.
Who among us would admit for a moment that
we are the counterpart or human representative of
the fox with its low cunning, the loquacious
jackdaw, the silly goose, the ungrateful viper, the
crow to be cajoled by flattery, not to mention the
egregious donkey? 'Satire,' says an acute writer,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
'is a sort of glass wherein beholders do generally
discover everybody's face but their own.' Or, to
parody a line of Young, 'All men think all men
peccable but themselves.' To be sure, we might
be willing, modestly perhaps, to admit that we
who are singers can emulate the nightingale; that
we even possess some of the&mdash;call it shrewdness,
of the fox; the faithful character of the honest
dog; vie in dignity of manners and bearing with
the stately lion. But all that is a matter of course;
the noble traits we possess are so self-evident that
none excepting the incorrigibly blind or prejudiced
will be found to dispute them! So that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the admonishing fable contains no lesson for any
of us, but should be seriously taken to heart, with
a view to their reformation, by certain persons
whom we all know. That view of the question,
however, need not be further pursued.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>LESSONS TAUGHT BY FABLES.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 14em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'The tale that I relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This lesson seems to carry.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Cowper</span>: <i>Pairing Time Anticipated</i>.</p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">In</span> the earlier ages of the world's history fables
were invented for the edification of men and
women. This was so in the palmiest days of
Greek, Roman and Arabian or Saracenic civilization.
In these later days fables are generally
assumed to be more for the delectation of children
than adults. This change of auditory need not
be regretted; it has its marked advantages. The
lesson which the fable inculcates is indelibly
stamped on the mind of the child, and has an
influence, less or more, on his or her career
during life.</p>

<p>Jean Jacques Rousseau is the only writer of
eminence who has inveighed against this use of
the fable, but his remarks are by no means convincing.
He accounted them lies without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
'medicinable quality,' and reprobated their employment
in the instruction of youth. 'Fables,'
says Rousseau, 'may amuse men, but the truth
must be told to children.' His animadversion had
special reference to the fables of La Fontaine,
and doubtless some of these, and the morals
deduced from them, are open to objection; but to
condemn fables in general on this account is
surely the height of unreason.</p>

<p>A greater than Rousseau had, long before, given
expression in cogent language to the worth of the
fable as a vehicle of instruction for youth. Plato,
whilst excluding the mythical stories of Hesiod
and Homer from the curriculum of his 'Republic'&mdash;that
perfect commonwealth, in depicting which
he lavished all the resources of his wisdom and
genius&mdash;advised mothers and nurses to repeat
selected fables to their children, so as to mould
and give direction to their young and tender
minds.</p>

<p>Ph&aelig;drus, again, in the prologue to his fables,
says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">''Tis but a play to form the youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fiction in the cause of truth,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">so that his view of the question also was just the
very antipodes of that of the French philosopher.</p>

<p>Quintilian urges<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that 'boys should learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
relate orally the fables of &AElig;sop, which follow
next after the nurse's stories.' True, he recommends
this with a view to initiating them in the
rudiments of the art of speaking; but he would
not have inculcated the use of fables for children
for even this secondary purpose, if he had dreamt
for a moment they would have had a bad effect on
their minds.</p>

<p>Rousseau, with all his knowledge of human
character and his power of imagination, had a
matter-of-fact vein running through his mind,
which led him to entertain the mistaken view
that the influence of fables on the juvenile mind
was objectionable. Cowper, who was no mean
writer of fables himself, with his clear common sense,
broad natural instincts, and mother wit&mdash;in
which Rousseau was lacking&mdash;saw the unwisdom
of the philosopher's conclusions, and satirized his
views in the well-known lines:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I shall not ask Jean Jacques Rousseau<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If birds confabulate or no;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis clear that they were always able<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hold discourse, at least in fable;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And e'en the child, who knows no better<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to interpret by the letter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A story of a cock and bull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must have a most uncommon skull.'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is no exaggeration to assert that the effect
which fables and their lessons have had on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
people is incalculable. They have been read and
rehearsed and pondered in all ages, and by thousands
whom no other class of literature could
attract. The story and its moral (in the &AElig;sopian
fable at least) are obvious to the dullest comprehension,
and they cling to the memory like the
limpet to the rock, and find their application in all
the concerns of daily life.</p>

<p>But it is not the illiterate alone that have
profited by the fable; all classes have been
affected by its lesson. We are all apt scholars
when the fable is the schoolmaster. There is no
class of the community that has not come under
its sway. It has penetrated to the highest stratum
of society equally with the humblest, and may be
credited with an influence as wide and far-reaching
as the sublimest moral treatise which the human
intellect has produced.</p>

<p>The epic and the novel (fables of a kind), like
some paintings, cover a wide canvas, and the
details are not always easily grasped and remembered;
but the true fable is a story in miniature
which we take in at a glance, and stow away for
after use in a small corner of our memory.</p>

<p>We have the 'successful villain' in the fable as
sometimes on the stage; and it may be a question
whether the tendency of this is not rather to
encourage dissimulation in certain ill-constituted
minds, than to inculcate virtue. One of Northcote's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fables, <i>The Elephant and the Fox</i>, will
exemplify what we mean.</p>

<p>'A grave and judicious elephant entering into
argument with a pert fox, who insisted upon his
superior powers of persuasion, which the elephant
would not allow, it was at length agreed between
them that whichever attracted the most attention
from his auditors by his eloquence should be
deemed the victor. At a certain appointed time
a great assembly of animals attended the trial,
and the elephant was allowed to speak first.
He with eloquence spoke of the high importance
of ever adhering with strictness to justice and
to truth; also of the happiness which resulted
from controlling the passions, of the dignity of
patience, the inhospitable and hateful nature of
selfishness, and the odiousness of cruelty and
carnage.</p>

<p>'The pert fox, perceiving the audience not to
be much amused by the discourse of the elephant,
made no ceremony, but interrupted the oration by
giving a farcical account of all his mischievous
tricks and hairbreadth escapes, the success of his
cunning, and his adroit contrivances to extricate
himself from harm&mdash;all which so delighted the
assembly, that the elephant was soon left, in the
midst of his wise advice, without a single auditor
near him; for they one and all with eagerness
thronged to hear the diverting follies and knaveries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the fox, who, of course, was in the end declared
the victor.'</p>

<p>It might almost appear that a fable of this kind
is an error of judgment, and that it is calculated to
do harm rather than good, inasmuch as it exhibits
the triumph of duplicity and the defeat of wisdom.
True, the author of the fable tries to recover the
lost ground in the application, by mildly holding
up the fox to reprobation, thus:</p>

<p>'Application: The effect these two orators had
on the perceptions of their audience was exactly
the reverse one to the other. That of the elephant
touched the guilty, like satire, with pain and
reproach; even the most innocent was humbled,
as none were wholly free from vice, and all felt
themselves lowered even in their own opinion, and
heard the admonition as an irksome duty, but still
with little inclination to undergo the difficult task
of amendment. But when the fox began, all was
joy; the innocent felt all the gratification which
proceeds from the consciousness of superiority,
and the guilty to find their vices and follies treated
only as a jest; for we all have felt how much more
pleasure we enjoy laughing at a fool than in being
scrutinized by the sage. From this cause it is that
farce of the most grotesque and absurd kind is
tolerated and received, and not without some
degree of relish, even by the good and the wise, as
we all want comfort.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the application&mdash;nay, rather to some
extent by reason of it, for the anti-climax is
extraordinary in a fable&mdash;it may be doubted
whether our sympathies are not with the fox
rather than with the elephant. We feel that the
latter, with all his wisdom and good advice, is
somewhat of a bore; whilst the fox, rake and
wastrel though he be, has that touch of nature
that makes him kin.</p>

<p>&AElig;sop's well-known fable of <i>The Fox and the
Crow</i> is also an example of the success of the
scoundrel, but mark the difference: here there is
the obvious reproof of the vain and silly bird,
deceived by flattering words, till, in attempting
to sing, she drops into the mouth of the fox the
savoury morsel she held in her beak! Here our
verdict is: 'Served her right!' In Northcote's
fable, clever though it is as a narration, this
climax is altogether wanting.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that there is a closer
natural affinity than at first sight appears between
man and the lower animals, and that the
recognition of this contact at many points would
suggest the idea of conferring the power of speech
upon the latter in the fable. In the higher reason
and its resultant effects they differ fundamentally;
mere animals are wanting discourse of reason,
but the purely animal passions of cunning, anger,
hatred, and even revenge and love of kind, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the nobler characteristics of faithfulness and
gratitude prevail in the dispositions of both.
These similarities would strike observers in the
pastoral ages of the world with even greater
force than in later times.</p>

<p>The ineradicable impression which certain
fables have made upon the mind through uncounted
generations by their self-evident appropriateness
and truth, is well exemplified in <i>The
Wolf and the Lamb</i>; <i>The Fox and the Grapes</i>; <i>The
Hare and the Tortoise</i>; <i>The Dog and the Shadow</i>;
<i>The Mountain in Labour</i>; <i>The Fox without a Tail</i>;
<i>The Satyr and the Man</i>, who blew hot and cold
with the same breath, and others. It is safe to
assert that nothing in literature has been more
quoted than the fables named. We could not
afford to lose them; their absence would be a
distinct loss&mdash;literature and life would be the
poorer without them; and, such being the fact,
we are justified in holding those writers in esteem
who have contributed to the instruction and
entertainment of mankind in the fables they have
invented.</p>

<small>&AElig;SOP.</small></h2>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">&AElig;sop</span> is justly regarded as the foremost
inventor of fables that the world has
seen. He flourished in the sixth century before
Christ. Several places, as in the case of Homer,
are claimed as his birthplace&mdash;Sardis in Lydia,
Ammorius, the island of Samos, and Mesembra,
a city of Thrace; but the weight of authority
is in favour of Coti&aelig;um, a city of Phrygia
in the Lesser Asia,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> hence his sobriquet of 'the
Phrygian.'</p>

<p>Whether he was a slave from birth is uncertain,
but if not, he became such, and served three
masters in succession. Demarchus or Caresias
of Athens was his first master; the next, Zanthus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
or Xanthus, a philosopher, of the island of Samos;
and the third, Idmon or Jadmon, also of Samos.
His faithful service and wisdom so pleased Idmon
that he gave &AElig;sop his freedom.</p>

<p>Growing in reputation both as a sage and a
wit, he associated with the wisest men of his
age. Amongst his contemporaries were the seven
sages of Greece: Periander, Thales, Solon, Cleobulus,
Chilo, Bias and Pittacus; but he was
eventually esteemed wiser than any of them.
The humour with which his sage counsels were
spiced made these more acceptable (both in his
own and later times) than the dull, if weighty,
wisdom of his compeers.</p>

<p>He became attached by invitation of Cr&#339;sus,
the rich King of Lydia, to the court at Sardis,
the capital, and continued under the patronage
of that monarch for the remainder of his life.
Cr&#339;sus employed him in various embassies which
he carried to a successful issue. The last he
undertook was a mission to Delphi to offer sacrifices
to Apollo, and to distribute four min&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of
silver to each citizen. To the character of the
Delphians might with justice be applied the saying
of a later time: 'The nearer the temple and
the farther from God.' Familiarity with the
Oracle, as is the case in smaller matters, bred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
contempt, for the meanness of their lives was
due to the circumstance that the offerings of
strangers coming to the temple of the god enabled
them to live a life of idleness, to the neglect
of the cultivation of their lands.</p>

<p>&AElig;sop upbraided them for this conduct, and,
scorning to encourage them in their evil habits,
instead of distributing amongst them the money
which Cr&#339;sus had sent, he returned it to Sardis.
This, as was natural with persons of their mean
character, so inflamed them against him that
they conspired to compass his destruction. Accordingly
(as the story goes), they hid away
amongst his baggage, as he was leaving the city,
a golden goblet taken from the temple and consecrated
to Apollo. Search being made, and the
vessel discovered, the charge of sacrilege was
brought against him. His judges pronounced
him guilty, and he was sentenced to be precipitated
from the rock Hyampia. Immediately
before his execution he delivered to his persecutors
the fable of <i>The Eagle and the Beetle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> by
which he warned them that even the weak may
procure vengeance against the strong for injuries
inflicted. The warning was unheeded by his
murderers. The shameful sentence was carried
out, and so &AElig;sop died, according to Eusebius, in
the fourth year of the fifty-fourth Olympiad, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
561 years before the Christian era. The fate of
poor &AElig;sop was like that of a good many other
world-menders!</p>

<p>According to ancient chroniclers, the death of
&AElig;sop did not go unavenged. Misfortunes of
many kinds overtook the Delphians; pestilence
decimated them; such of their lands as they
tried to cultivate were rendered barren, with
famine as the result, and these miseries continued
to afflict them for many years. At length,
having consulted the Oracle, they received as
answer that which their secret conscience affirmed
to be true, that their calamities were due to the
death of &AElig;sop, whom they had so unjustly condemned.
Thereupon they caused proclamation
to be made in all public places throughout the
country, offering reparation to any of &AElig;sop's
representatives who should appear. The only
claimant that responded was a grandson of
Idmon, &AElig;sop's former master; and having made
such expiation as he demanded, the Delphians
were delivered from their troubles.</p>

<p>Not only was &AElig;sop unfortunate in his death:
his personal appearance has suffered disparagement.
The most trustworthy chroniclers in
ancient times describe him as a man of good
appearance, and even of a pleasing cast of
countenance; whereas in later years he has
been portrayed both by writers and in pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
as deformed in body and repellent in features.
Stob&aelig;us, it is true, who lived in the fifth century
<span class="smcapl">A.D.</span>, had written disparagingly of 'the air of
&AElig;sop's countenance,' representing the fabulist
as a man of sour visage, and intractable, but he
goes no farther than that.</p>

<p>It is to Maximus Planudes, a Constantinople
monk of the fourteenth century, nearly two
thousand years after the time of &AElig;sop, that the
burlesque of the great fabulist is due. Planudes
appears to have collected all the stories regarding
&AElig;sop current during the Middle Ages, and
strung them together as an authentic history.
Through ignorance, or by intention, he also confounded
the Oriental fabulist, Locman,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> with
&AElig;sop, and clothed the latter in all the admitted
deformities of the other. He affirmed him as
having been flat-faced, hunch-backed, jolt-headed,
blubber-lipped, big-bellied, baker-legged, his body
crooked all over, and his complexion of a swarthy
hue. Even in recent years, accepting the description
of the monk, &AElig;sop has been thus
depicted in the frontispiece to his fables. This
writer is untrustworthy in other respects, for in
his pretended life of the sage he makes him
speak of persons who did not exist, and of events
that did not occur for eighty to two hundred
years after his death.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>That the story of &AElig;sop's hideous deformity
is untrue is clear from evidence that is on
record. Admitted that this evidence is chiefly of
a negative kind, it is sufficiently strong to refute
the statements of the monk. In the first place,
Planudes, as we have seen, is an untrustworthy
chronicler in other respects, and an account of
&AElig;sop, written after the lapse of two thousand
years, could only be worthy of credence issuing
from a truthful pen, and based on documentary
or other unquestionable evidence. Of such
evidence the Constantinople monk had probably
none.</p>

<p>Again, it is related that during the years of
his slavery &AElig;sop had as mate, or wife, the
beautiful Rhodope,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> also a slave&mdash;an unlikely
circumstance, assuming him to have been as
repulsive in bodily appearance as has been
asserted. At all events, any incongruous association
of this kind would have been remarked and
commented on by earlier writers.</p>

<p>Further, none of &AElig;sop's contemporaries, nor
any writers that immediately followed him, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
mention of his alleged deformities. On the contrary,
the Athenians, about two hundred years
after his death, in order to perpetuate his memory
and appearance, commissioned the celebrated
sculptor Lysippus to produce a statue of &AElig;sop,
and this they erected in a prominent position in
front of those of the seven sages, 'because,' says
Ph&aelig;drus,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> 'their severe manner did not persuade,
while the jesting of &AElig;sop pleased and
instructed at the same time.' It is improbable
that the figure of a man monstrously deformed
as &AElig;sop is said to have been would have proved
acceptable to the severe taste of the Greek mind.
An epigram of Agathia, of which the following
is a translation,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> celebrates the erection of this
statue:</p>

<h3>'<span class="smcap">To Lysippus.</span></h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Above the rigid censor him I hold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who teaches virtue while he wins our hearts.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>
<p>Philostratus, in an account of certain pictures
in existence in the time of the Antonines, describes
one as representing &AElig;sop with a pleasing
cast of countenance, in the midst of a circle of
the various animals, and the Geniuses of Fable
adorning him with wreaths of flowers and branches
of the olive.</p>

<p>Dr. Bentley, in his 'Dissertation,' ridicules
the account of &AElig;sop's deformity as given by
Planudes in face of all the evidence to the contrary.
'I wish,' says he, 'I could do that justice
to the memory of our Phrygian, to oblige the
painters to change their pencil. For 'tis certain
he was no deformed person; and 'tis probable
he was very handsome. For whether he was
a Phrygian or, as others say, a Thracian, he
must have been sold into Samos by a trader in
slaves; and 'tis well known that that sort of
people commonly bought up the most beautiful
they could light on, because they would yield the
most profit.'</p>

<p>Bentley's conjecture that &AElig;sop was 'very
handsome' does not find general acceptance; it
has, nevertheless, a solid foundation in the fact
that the Greeks confined art to the imitation of
the beautiful only, reprobating the portrayal of
ugly forms, whether human or other. It is not
to be believed, therefore, that the chisel of
Lysippus was employed in the production of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
statue to a deformed person, which not even
the gift of wisdom would have rendered acceptable
to the severe taste of his countrymen.
Without going so far, however, as to accept the
view of the learned Master of Trinity, that &AElig;sop
was probably <i>very</i> handsome, we may with safety
conclude that the objectionable portrait of the
sage as drawn by the Byzantine is without
justification.</p>

</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">James Clerk Maxwell.</span></p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">There</span> are numerous tales told of &AElig;sop,
some of which are obviously mythical;
others, though their actual parentage may be
doubtful, are entirely in keeping with his reputation
for common, or uncommon, sense and
ready wit. Ph&aelig;drus has several of these, and
Planudes, an untrustworthy chronicler, as we
have seen, has many more. Some of the stories
of the latter are absurd enough, and bordering
perhaps on the foolish; but, on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he tells several that may be pronounced excellent
in every sense, and whatever the shortcomings
of the monk in other respects, he
deserves credit for having rescued these from
the oblivion which otherwise might have been
their fate.</p>

<p>Most writers, especially modern writers, on
&AElig;sop, have scouted with an unnecessary display
of eclecticism the whole of the stories
collected by Planudes regarding his hero; but
in this they show a want of discrimination.
Whether the stories are true of &AElig;sop or not,
and I know of no character on whom they may
be more aptly fathered, they are as ripe in
wisdom as are many of the best of the fables,
and their pedigree is quite as authentic.</p>

<p>Philostratus, in his life of Apollonius Tyaneus,
gives the following mythical account of the
youthful &AElig;sop: When a shepherd's boy, he
fed his flock near a temple of Mercury, and
frequently prayed to the god for mental endowments.
Many other supplicants also came and
laid rich presents upon the altar, but &AElig;sop's
only offering was a little milk and honey, and a
few flowers, which the care of his sheep did
not allow him to arrange with much art. The
mercenary god disposed of his gifts in proportion
to the value of the offerings. To one he gave
philosophy, to another eloquence, to a third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
astronomy, and to a fourth the poetical art.
When all these were given away he perceived
&AElig;sop, and recollecting a fable which the Hours
had related to him in his infancy, he bestowed
upon him the invention of the Apologue.</p>

<p>Even when a slave, readiness of resource was
a characteristic of &AElig;sop, and often stood him
in good stead. His first master, Demarchus,
one day brought home some choice figs, which
he handed to his butler, telling him that he
would partake of them after his bath. The
butler had a friend paying him a visit, and by
way of entertainment placed the figs before him,
and both heartily partook of them. Fearing
the displeasure of Demarchus, he resolved to
charge &AElig;sop with the theft. Having finished
his ablutions, Demarchus ordered the fruit to
be brought; but the butler had none to bring,
and charged &AElig;sop with having stolen and eaten
them. The slave, being summoned, denied the
charge. It was a serious matter for one in his
position. To be guilty meant many stripes, if
not death. He begged to have some warm
water, and he would prove his innocence. The
water being brought, he took a deep drink; then,
putting his finger down his gullet, the water&mdash;the
sole contents of his stomach&mdash;was belched.
Demarchus now ordered the butler to do the
same, with the result that he was proved to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
both thief and liar, and was punished accordingly.</p>

<p>&AElig;sop going on a journey for his master, along
with other slaves of the household, and there
being many burdens to carry, he begged they
would not overload him. Looking upon him as
weak in body, his fellow-slaves gave him his
choice of a load. On this, &AElig;sop selected the
pannier of bread, which was the heaviest burden
of all, at which his companions were amazed,
and thought him a fool. Noon came, however,
and when they had each partaken of its contents,
&AElig;sop's burden was lightened by one half.
At the next meal all the bread was cleared out,
leaving &AElig;sop with only the empty basket to
carry. At this their eyes were opened, and
instead of the fool they at first thought him, he
was seen to be the wisest of them all.</p>

<p>The second master who owned &AElig;sop as a
slave was Zanthus, the philosopher. Their meeting
was in this wise: &AElig;sop being in the marketplace
for sale along with two other slaves,
Zanthus, who was looking round with a view to
making a purchase, asked them what they could
do. &AElig;sop's companions hastened to reply,
and between them professed that they could do
'everything.' On &AElig;sop being similarly questioned,
he laughingly answered, 'Nothing.' His
two fellow-slaves had forestalled him in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
possible work, and left him with nothing to do.
This reply so amused Zanthus that he selected
&AElig;sop in preference to the others who were so
boastful of their abilities.</p>

<p>Zanthus once, when in his cups, had foolishly
wagered his land and houses that he would
drink the sea dry. Recovering his senses, he
besought &AElig;sop his slave to find him a way out
of his difficulty. This &AElig;sop engaged to do.
At the appointed time, when the foolish feat
was to be performed, or his houses and lands
forfeited, Zanthus, previously instructed by
&AElig;sop, appeared at the seaside before the
multitude which had assembled to witness his
expected discomfiture. 'I am ready,' cried he,
'to drain the waters of the sea to the last drop;
but first of all you must stop the rivers from
running into it: to drink these also is not in
the contract.' The request was admitted to be
a reasonable one, and as his opponents were
powerless to perform their part, they were
covered with derision by the populace, who
were loud in their praises of the wisdom of
Zanthus.</p>

<p>Philosopher notwithstanding, Zanthus appears
to have been often in hot water. On another
occasion his wife left him, whether on account
of her bad temper (as the report goes), or from
his too frequent indulgence in liquor (as is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
unlikely), matters little. He was anxious that
she should return, but how to induce her was
a difficulty hard to compass. &AElig;sop, as usual,
was equal to it. 'Leave it to me, master!' said
he. Going to market, he gave orders to this
dealer and that and the other, to send of their
best to the residence of Zanthus, as, being about
to take unto himself another wife, he intended
to celebrate the happy occasion by a feast. The
report spread like wildfire, and coming to the
ears of his spouse, she quickly gathered up her
belongings in the place where she had taken up
her abode, and returned to the house of her
lord and master. 'Take another wife, say you,
Zanthus! Not whilst I am alive, my dear!'
And so the ruse was successful, for, as the story
affirms, she settled down to her duties, and no
further cause for separation occurred between
them ever after.</p>

<p>Ph&aelig;drus relates several stories showing the
characteristic readiness of the sage. A mean
fellow, seeing &AElig;sop in the street, threw a stone
at him. 'Well done!' was his response to the
unmannerly action. 'See! here is a penny for
you; on my faith it is all I have, but I will tell
you how you may get something more. See,
yonder comes a rich and influential man. Throw
a stone at him in the same way, and you will
receive a due reward.' The rude fool, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
persuaded, did as he was advised. His daring
impudence, however, brought him a requital he
did not hope for, though it was what he deserved,
for, being seized, he paid the penalty. &AElig;sop in
this incident exhibited not only his ready wit,
but his deep craft, inasmuch as he brought
condign punishment upon his persecutor by the
hand of another, though he himself, being only
a slave, might be insulted with impunity.</p>

<p>An Athenian, seeing &AElig;sop at play in the midst
of a crowd of boys, stopped and laughed and
jeered at him for a madman. The sage, a
laugher at others rather than one to be laughed
at, perceiving this, placed an unstrung bow in
the middle of the road. 'Hark you, wise man,'
said he; 'unriddle what this means.' The people
gathered round, whilst the man tormented his
invention for a long time, trying to frame an
answer to the riddle; but at last he gave it up.
Upon this the victorious philosopher said: 'The
bow will soon break if you always keep it bent,
but relax it occasionally, and it will be fit for
use, and strong, when it is wanted'&mdash;a piece of
sound advice which others than the wiseacre
chiefly concerned would find it advantageous to
practise.</p>

<p>A would-be author had recited some worthless
composition to &AElig;sop, in which was contained
an inordinate eulogy of himself and his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
powers, and, desiring to know what the sage
thought about it, asked: 'Does it appear to you
that I have been too conceited? I have no
empty confidence in my own capacity.' Worried
to death with the execrable production, &AElig;sop
replied: 'I greatly approve of your bestowing
praise on yourself, for it will never be your lot
to receive it from another.'</p>

<p>In the course of a conversation, being asked
by Chilo (one of the wise men of Greece), 'What
is the employment of the gods?' &AElig;sop's answer
was: 'To depress the proud and exalt the humble.'
And in allusion to the sorrows inseparable from
the human lot, his explanation, at once striking
and poetical, was that 'Prometheus having taken
earth to form mankind, moistened and tempered
it, not with water, but with tears.'</p>

<p>Apart from wisdom in the highest sense, &AElig;sop
possessed no little share of worldly wisdom, or
political wisdom&mdash;often only another name for
chicane&mdash;and exercised it as occasion served. It
is related by Plutarch, in the 'Life of Solon,' that
'&AElig;sop being at the Court of Cr&#339;sus at a time
when the seven sages of Greece were also present,
the King, having shown them the magnificence
of his Court and the vastness of his riches, asked
them, "Whom do you think the happiest man?"
Some of them named one, and some another.
Solon (whom without injury we may look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
as superior to all the rest) in his answer gave two
instances. The first was that of one Tellus, a
poor Athenian, but of great virtues, who had
eminently distinguished himself by his care and
education of his family, and at last lost his life
in fighting for his country. The other was of
two brothers who had given a very remarkable
proof of their filial piety, and were in reward for
it taken out of this life by the gods the very night
after they had performed so dutiful an action.
He concluded by adding that he had given
such instances because no one could be pronounced
happy before his death. &AElig;sop perceived
that the King was not well satisfied with
any of their answers, and being asked the same
question, replied "that for his part he was persuaded
that Cr&#339;sus had as much pre-eminence
in happiness over all other men as the sea has
over all the rivers."</p>

<p>'The King was so much pleased with this compliment
that he eagerly pronounced that sentence
which afterwards became a common proverb,
"The Phrygian has hit the mark." Soon after
this happened, Solon took his leave of Cr&#339;sus,
and was dismissed very coolly. &AElig;sop, on his
departure, accompanied him part of his journey,
and as they were on the road took an opportunity
of saying to him, "Oh, Solon, either we must not
speak to kings, or we must say what will please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
them." "On the contrary," replied Solon, "we
should either not speak to kings at all, or we
should give them good and useful advice." So
great was the steadiness of the chief of the sages,
and such the courtliness of &AElig;sop.'<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>It will be noticed that this reply of &AElig;sop to
the question of the King was evasive, though the
vanity of the latter probably prevented his remarking
it. He does not declare the King to be
the happiest man, but leaves it to be inferred
that, assuming happiness to be attained by men
during life (which Solon denied), then was Cr&#339;sus
pre-eminent over all others in that respect. It
must be admitted that the answer does not
display the character of &AElig;sop in the best light
as a moralist, however much it may exalt his
reputation as a courtier. There probably was a
good deal of the fox in his nature, and this, not
less than his wisdom, enabled him to maintain
his position at the Court of this vain and wealthy
potentate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>THE &AElig;SOPIAN FABLES.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Brevity is the soul of wit.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>: <i>Hamlet</i>.</p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">It</span> has been asserted that this same &AElig;sop, if
not a mythical personage, is at least credited
with much more than is his due, and that it is
only around his name that have clustered the
various fables attributed to him, like rich juicy
grapes round their central stalk, or, to use a
more appropriate image, like swarming bees
round a pendent branch. Others have endeavoured,
with less or more feasibility, to prove
that most of what are called &AElig;sopian fables had
their origin in the far East&mdash;'The inquisitive
amongst the Greeks,' say they, 'travelled into the
East to ripen their own imperfect conceptions,
and on their return taught them at home, with
the mixture of fables and ornaments of fancy'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;that
the ideas first propounded in India and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Arabia were thus carried westward; that &AElig;sop
appropriated them and gave them forth in a
modified form and in a new dress. Scholars and
investigators differ in their views regarding the
truth, or the extent of the truth, of these allegations,
and display much erudition in their attempts
to settle the question. It would appear that &AElig;sop
has indubitably the credit of certain fables of
which he was not the inventor, as they were in
vogue at a period anterior to the era in which he
flourished. It is equally proved, on the other
hand, that genuine &AElig;sopian or Grecian fables
have been attributed to Eastern sources, and are
found included in collections of Eastern fables
compiled in the earlier years of the Christian era.
All this is only what might be expected, and does
not affect to any serious extent the credit for ingenuity
and originality of either &AElig;sop or other
early fabulists. Doubtless &AElig;sop did get some
of the subjects of his fables from foreign sources,
but he melted them in the crucible of his mind&mdash;he
distilled their very essence, and handed us the
precious concentrated spirit. If he had done
nothing more, that was good.</p>

<p>It is well known, of course, that there were
fables of a very excellent kind before the time of
&AElig;sop. Amongst the &AElig;sopian fables supposed to
be borrowed from the J&#257;takas are <i>The Wolf and
the Crane</i>, <i>The Ass in the Lion's Skin</i>, <i>The Lion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Mouse</i>, and <i>The Countryman, his Son and the Snake</i>.
And Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> asserts that the language of
Hesiod's nightingale to the hawk (spoken three
hundred years before the era of &AElig;sop) is the
origin of the beautiful and instructive wisdom in
which &AElig;sop has employed so many tongues.
Thus:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Poor Philomel, one luckless day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell in a hungry falcons way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If he her life," she said, "would spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He should have something choice and rare."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What's that?" quoth he. "A song," she says,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Melodious as Apollo's lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with delight all nature hears."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A hungry belly has no ears,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied the hawk, "I first must sup,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ate the little siren up.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When strength and resolution fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talents and graces nought avail.'<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Archilochus also wrote fables before &AElig;sop;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and even anterior to these is the fable of <i>The
Belly and the Members</i>, and those given in Holy
Scripture. But, without question, &AElig;sop was a
true inventor of fables, for it is not to be believed
for a moment that Greek genius (and this was the
genius of &AElig;sop, whatever his parentage) was not
equal to such a task.</p>

<p>Doubtless many later, as well as earlier, fables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
are included under the general designation of
'&AElig;sopian,' by virtue of their resembling in the
characteristics of brevity, force and wit the inventions
of the sage.</p>

<p>&AElig;sop in all probability did not write out his
fables; they were handed down by word of mouth
from generation to generation. At length they
were collected together, first by Diagoras (400 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>),
and later by Demetrius Phalereus, the Tyrant of
Athens (318 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>), under the title of 'The
Assemblies of &AElig;sopian Fables,' long after the
sage's death. This collection was made use of
both by the Greek freedman Ph&aelig;drus, during the
reign of Augustus, in the early years of the Christian
era, and later by Valerius Babrius, the
Roman (230 <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span>). Later again, towards the end
of the fourth century, a number of them were
translated into Latin by Avienus.</p>

<p>The &AElig;sopian fables are distinguished by their
simplicity, their mother-wit and natural humour.
A score of examples exhibiting these qualities might
be cited. A few, not the best known, will suffice:</p>

<p><i>The Wolf and the Shepherds.</i>&mdash;'A wolf peeping
into a hut where a company of shepherds were
regaling themselves with a joint of mutton&mdash;"Lord,"
said he, "what a clamour would these
men have raised if they had caught <i>me</i> at such a
banquet!"'</p>

<p>The compression and humour of this fable are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
remarkable, and the obvious moral is: 'That men
are apt to condemn in others what they practise
themselves without scruple.'</p>

<p><i>The Dog and the Crocodile</i> bids us be on our
guard against associating with persons of an ill
reputation. 'As a dog was coursing the banks of
the Nile, he grew thirsty; but fearing to be seized
by the monsters of that river, he would not stop
to satiate his drought, but lapped as he ran. A
crocodile, raising his head above the surface of
the water, asked him why he was in such a hurry.
He had often, he said, wished for his acquaintance,
and should be glad to embrace the present opportunity.
"You do me great honour," returned the
dog, "but it is to avoid such companions as you
that I am in so much haste."'</p>

<p>Again, <i>The Snake and the Hedgehog</i>. 'By the
intreaties of a hedgehog, half starved with cold, a
snake was once persuaded to receive him into her
cell. He was no sooner entered than his prickles
began to be very annoying to his companion,
upon which the snake desired he would provide
himself another lodging, as she found, upon trial,
the apartment was not large enough to accommodate
both. "Nay," said the hedgehog, "let them
that are uneasy in their situation exchange it;
for my own part, I am very well contented where
I am; if you are not, you are welcome to remove
whenever you think proper!"'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The fable (or rather story, for it is more an
anecdote than a fable) of <i>Mercury and the Sculptor</i>
reads like a joke of yesterday. In Mr. Cross's
'Life of George Eliot,' it is recorded that the
great novelist (in a conversation with Mr. Burne-Jones)
recalled her passionate delight and total
absorption in &AElig;sop's fables, the possession of
which, when a child, had opened new worlds to
her imagination, and she laughed till the tears
ran down her face in recalling her infantine enjoyment
of the humour of this story, as follows:</p>

<p>'Mercury once determined to learn in what
esteem he was held among mortals. For this
purpose he assumed the character of a man, and
visited in this disguise the studio of a sculptor.
Having looked at various statues, he demanded
the price of two figures of Jupiter and Juno.
When the sum at which they were valued was
named, he pointed to a figure of himself, saying to
the sculptor: "You will certainly want much
more for this, as it is the statue of the messenger
of the gods, and the author of all your
gain." The sculptor replied, "Well, if you will
buy these, I'll fling you that into the bargain."'</p>

<p>Again, take <i>The Bull and the Gnat</i>, intended to
show that the least considerable of mankind are
seldom destitute of importance:</p>

<p>'A conceited gnat, fully persuaded of his own
importance, having placed himself on the horn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of a bull, expressed great uneasiness lest his
weight should be incommodious; and with much
ceremony begged the bull's pardon for the liberty
he had taken, assuring him that he would immediately
remove if he pressed too hard upon him.
"Give yourself no uneasiness on that account, I
beseech you," replied the bull, "for as I never
perceived when you sat down, I shall probably not
miss you whenever you think fit to rise up."'</p>

<p>Here, again, the humour is exquisite; but, indeed,
that is a characteristic of nearly all the
fables ascribed to &AElig;sop.</p>

<p>The fable does not readily lend itself to the
expression of pathos. Perhaps the only really
pathetic fable is that of <i>The Wolf and the Lamb</i>,
and it is also one of the very best. In this there
is a touch of genuine pathos, unique in its character.
Hesiod's <i>Hawk and Nightingale</i>,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and <i>The
Old Woodcutter and Death</i>, as told by La Fontaine,
are not wanting in pathos.</p>

<p>The applicability of the fables of &AElig;sop to the
circumstances and occurrences of every-day life,
in the highest walks as in the humblest&mdash;for the
nature in both is human, after all&mdash;gives them
peculiar value. This, and their epigrammatical
character, so conspicuous in the best, combined
with the humorous turn that is given to them,
impresses them upon the memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>In such repute have the &AElig;sopian fables always
been held, that the most learned men in all ages
have occupied themselves in translating and
transcribing them. Socrates relieved his prison
hours in turning some of them into verse.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In
the days of ancient Greece, not to be familiar with
&AElig;sop was a sign of illiteracy.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>We have seen how other of the ancients collected
and disseminated them. Coming down to
later times, one of the first printed collections
was by Bonus Accursius (1489,) from a MS. in
the Ambrosian Library at Milan. To this was
prefixed the Life by Planudes, written a century
before. Another edition of the same was published
by Aldus in 1505. The edition of Robert
Stephens, published in Paris in 1546, followed;
then came the enlarged collection by Neveletus,
from the Heidelberg Library, in 1610. Later,
Gabriele Faerno's 'One Hundred Fables' are
&AElig;sop given in Latin verse. So also with most
of the collections by modern fabulists, La Fontaine,
Sir Roger L'Estrange, Dr. Samuel Croxall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
La Motte, Richer, Brettinger, Bitteux&mdash;they are
all largely &AElig;sop, with added pieces of later
invention.</p>

<p>'&AElig;sop has been agreed by all ages since his
era for the greatest Master in his kind, and all
others of that sort have been but imitations of his
original.'<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Of the popularity of &AElig;sop's fables in book form
during last century and the beginning of this, we
can scarcely form any conception in these days
of cheap literature in such variety and excellence.
Along with the Bible and 'The Pilgrim's Progress,'
&AElig;sop may be said to have occupied a place on the
meagre bookshelf of almost every cottage.</p>

<p>The editions of &AElig;sop in English are innumerable,
but the most noteworthy, in the different
epochs from the age of the invention of printing
downwards have been: Caxton's collection (1484);
the one by Leonard Willans (1650); that by John
Ogilby (1651); Sir Roger L'Estrange's edition
(1692); Dr. Croxall's collection (1722); that of
Robert Dodsley (1764); and the Rev. Thomas
James's &AElig;sop (1848).</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the majority of those who
have busied themselves in translating and editing
&AElig;sop have won fame and (shall we say?) immortality
through that circumstance alone. Take the
names in order of time, and it will be seen that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
men are remembered chiefly or only (most of them)
by reason of their association with the &AElig;sopian
fables: Demetrius Phalereus, Ph&aelig;drus, Babrius,
Avienus, Planudes, Bonus Accursius, Neveletus,
even down to La Fontaine, L'Estrange,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Croxall,
and James. The &AElig;sopian fable has indeed a
perennial life, and its votaries have rendered themselves
immortal by association therewith.</p>

<p>Writers of much erudition, and in many
countries, have vied with each other in learned
research in this branch of literature, and in endeavours
to trace the history of fable. Among
the French we have Pierre Pithou (1539-96),
editor of the first printed edition of Ph&aelig;drus;
Bachet de Meziriac, who wrote a life of &AElig;sop
(1632); Boissonade, Robert, Edelestand du Meril
(1854); Hervieux and Gaston Paris. Of German
writers there are Lessing, Fausboll, Hermann
Oesterley, Mueller, Wagener, Heydenreich, Otto
Crusius (1879), Benfey, Mall, Knoell, Gitlbauer;
Niccolo, Perotti, Archbishop of Siponto (1430-80),
and Jannelli, among the Italians; amongst Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
writers, Dr. Landsberger. Of English writers we
have Christopher Wase, Alsop, Boyle, Bentley,
Tyrwhitt, Rutherford, James, Robinson Ellis,
Rhys-Davids, G. F. Townsend, and last but not
least, Joseph Jacobs, in his scholarly 'History of
the &AElig;sopic Fable.'</p>

</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Cowper</span>: <i>The Task (altered)</i>.</p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">Ph&aelig;drus</span>, who wrote the fables of &AElig;sop in
Latin iambics, and added others of his own,
was born at the very source of poetic inspiration,
on Mount Pierius, near to the Pierian spring, the
seat of the Muses, in Thrace, at that time a portion
of the Roman province of Macedonia, and
of which Octavius, the father of Augustus C&aelig;sar,
was Proconsul, during the last century before the
Christian era. Like &AElig;sop, he too was a slave in
early youth, but being taken to Rome, he was
manumitted by Augustus, and occupied a place
in the household of that Emperor. Here he
acquired the pure Latinity of his style, and in later
years wrote the well-known fables in the collection
that bears his name. His fables are in five books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and were published during the reign of Tiberius
and subsequent emperors.</p>

<p>In the prologue to his third book, addressed to
Eutychus,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he thus alludes to his birthplace, and
disavows all mercenary aims in his literary
pursuits:</p>

</div></div>

<p>His object, as he declares, was to expose vice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and folly; in pursuing it he did not escape persecution,
for Sejanus, the arbitrary minister of
Tiberius (who had now succeeded to the imperial
purple), took mortal offence at certain of the
apologues which he suspected applied to himself,
and, 'informer, witness, judge and all,' laid the
iron hand of power heavy upon the fabulist.
Ph&aelig;drus, whose early years of slavery had left no
taint of servility upon his character, was too independent
to stoop to insolent power, and resented
the treatment to which he was subjected. Thus
beset, and probably largely owing to this cause,
his last years were spent in poverty. Amidst the
infirmities of age he compares himself to the old
hound in his last apologue, which being chastised
by his master for his feebleness in allowing the
boar to escape, replied, 'Spare your old servant!
It was the power, not the will, that failed me.
Remember rather what I was than abuse me for
what I am.' A lesson which even at the present
day may sometimes find its application. Ph&aelig;drus
prophesied his own immortality as an author, and
his boast was that whilst &AElig;sop invented, he
(Ph&aelig;drus) perfected.</p>

<p>Babrius,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> a Latin, did for the &AElig;sopian fable,
in Greek choliambics, what Ph&aelig;drus, a Greek,
accomplished for them in Latin iambics. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
believed to have lived in the third century <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span>,
and to have composed his fables in his quality of
tutor to Branchus, the young son of the Emperor
Alexander Severus.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> His collection of &AElig;sopian
fables in two books was known to ancient writers,
who refer to him and quote his apologues, but,
like other literary treasures, it was lost during the
Middle Ages. Early in the seventeenth century,
Isaac Nicholas Neveletus, a Swiss, published
(1610) an edition of the fables of &AElig;sop, containing
not only those embraced in the work of
Planudes, but additional fables from MSS. in the
Vatican Library, and some from Aphthonius and
Babrius. He further expressed the opinion that
the latter was the earliest collector and writer of
the &AElig;sopian fables in Greek. Francis Vavassor,
a French Jesuit, followed with comments on
Babrius on the same lines; so also another Frenchman,
Bayle, in his 'Dictionnaire Historique';
Thomas Tyrwhitt and Dr. Bentley in England,
and Francisco de Furia in Italy, also espoused
the idea first suggested by Neveletus, and adduced
further proofs in support of it. Singularly enough,
the accuracy of the forecast of these scholars was
established by the discovery in 1840, by M.
Minoides Menas, a Greek, at the Convent of
St. Laura on Mount Athos, of a veritable copy
of Babrius in Greek choliambic verse. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
transcript of Menas was first published in Paris
in 1844. The first English edition was edited by
Sir George Cornewall Lewis in the original Greek
text, with Latin notes, and afterwards (1860)
translated into English by the Rev. James
Davies, M.A., and they now form the most
trustworthy version of the &AElig;sopian fables.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>THE FABLE IN HISTORY AND MYTH.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Full of wise saws.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>: <i>As You Like It</i>.</p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">'Fables,'</span> says Aristotle, 'are adapted to
deliberate oratory, and possess this advantage:
that to hit upon facts which have occurred
in point is difficult; but with regard to fables it is
comparatively easy. For an orator ought to construct
them just as he does his illustrations, if he
be able to discover the point of similitude, a thing
which will be easy to him if he be of a philosophical
turn of mind.'<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The truth of this is exemplified in the use
which has been made of the apologue by orators
in all ages, but especially in early times.</p>

<p>The following instances of the application of
fables to particular occasions are recorded. The
fable of <i>The Belly and the Members</i>, which is reputed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to be the oldest in existence, is of sterling
excellence, as well as of venerable antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Its
lucid moral is truth in essence. The logic of its
conclusion is as invulnerable as the demonstration
of a proposition in Euclid. There is no gainsaying
it, turn it how we may, and, with all due
deference to Montaigne, only one moral is deducible
from it. This is solid bottom ground and
bed rock, safe for chain-cable holding; safe for
building upon, however high the superstructure.
Striking use was made of it by Menenius Agrippa
when the rabble refused to pay their share of the
taxes necessary for carrying on the business of
the State.</p>

<p>In the 'Coriolanus' of Shakespeare, Menenius,
the Roman Consul, is introduced in character,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and
recounts the apologue to the disaffected citizens
of Rome. Thus the dramatist, in his superb
way:</p>

<p>The oldest fable in Holy Scripture, having been
spoken or written about six centuries before the
time of &AElig;sop, is that of <i>The Trees in Search of a
King</i>, recounted by Jotham to the men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Shechem, and directed against Abimelech,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
wherein it is shown that the most worthless
persons are generally the most presuming:</p>

<p>'And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves
together, and all the house of Millo, and
went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the
pillar that was in Shechem. And when they told
it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of
Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried
and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of
Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. The
Trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over
them; and they said unto the Olive-tree, Reign
thou over us. But the Olive-tree said unto them,
Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they
honour God and man, and go to wave to and fro
over the trees? And the Trees said to the Fig-tree,
Come thou, and reign over us. But the
Fig-tree said unto them, Should I leave my sweetness,
and my good fruit, and go to wave to and
fro over the trees? And the Trees said unto the
Vine, Come thou, and reign over us. And the
Vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine,
which cheereth God and man, and go to wave to
and fro over the trees? Then said all the Trees
unto the Bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
And the Bramble said unto the trees, If in truth
ye anoint me king over you, then come and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
your trust in my shadow; and if not, let fire come
out of the Bramble, and devour the cedars of
Lebanon.'</p>

<p>The Samians had impeached their Prime
Minister for embezzling the money of the Commonwealth,
and would have put him to death.
&AElig;sop, addressing the assembled councillors, introduced
the fable of <i>The Fox and the Hedgehog</i>
into his oration, as an argument to dissuade them
from their purpose.</p>

<p>'A fox, swimming across a rapid river, was
carried by the current into a deep ravine, where
he lay for a time bruised and sick, and unable to
move. A swarm of hungry flies<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> settled upon
him. A hedgehog, passing by, compassionated
his sufferings, and would have driven away the
flies that were tormenting him. "Pray do not
molest them," cried the fox. "How is this?"
asked the hedgehog. "Do you not want to be
rid of them?" "By no means," replied the fox;
"for these flies are now full of blood, and sting
me but little, and if you rid me of these which
are already satiated, others more hungry will
come in their place, and will drink up all the
blood I have left." Thus also, O Samians, this man
no longer injures you, for he is wealthy; should
you, however, put him to death, others who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
poor will come, who will exhaust you by filching
the public money.'</p>

<p>Such a plea in arrest of judgment would hardly
suffice in these later days.</p>

<p>The fable of <i>The Frogs petitioning Jupiter for a
King</i> was spoken by &AElig;sop to the Athenians in
order to reconcile them to the mild yoke of the
usurper Pisistratus, against whom, after they had
raised him to the supreme power, the people began
to murmur. 'The Commonwealth of Frogs, a
discontented, variable race, weary of liberty, and
fond of a change, petitioned Jupiter to grant them
a king. The good-natured deity, in order to indulge
this their request with as little mischief to
the petitioners as possible, threw them down a
log. At first they regarded their new monarch
with great reverence, and kept from him at a most
respectful distance; but perceiving his tame and
peaceable disposition, they by degrees ventured
to approach him with more familiarity, till at
length some of them even ventured to climb up
his side and squat upon him, and they all conceived
for him the utmost contempt. In this
disposition, they renewed their request to Jupiter,
and entreated him to bestow upon them another
king. The Thunderer in his wrath sent them a
crane, who no sooner took possession of his new
dominions than he began to devour his subjects
one after another in a most capricious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
tyrannical manner. They were now more dissatisfied
than before; when applying to Jupiter
a third time, they were dismissed with the reproof
that the evil they complained of they had imprudently
brought upon themselves, and that they
had no remedy now but to submit to it with
patience.'</p>

<p>Plutarch, in his account of 'The Feast of the
Sages' at the Court of Periander, King of Corinth
(himself one of the seven), narrates the incident
of Alexidemus, natural son of the Tyrant of
Miletus, who, having taken offence at being placed
lower at the table than '&AElig;olians, and Islanders,
and people known to nobody,' was ridiculed by
&AElig;sop, who related to the assembled guests the
fable of <i>The Arrogant Mule mortified</i>. 'The lion,'
said he, 'gave a feast to the beasts. The horse
and the ass sent excuses, the one having to bear
his master a journey, and the other to turn the
mill for the housewife; but, in order to honour
the hospitality of the forest king, they sent their
son, the mule, in their stead. At table a dispute
arose about precedence, the mule claiming the
higher place in right of his parent the horse,
which the ox and others disputed, asserting that
the mule had no just pretensions to the dignity
claimed. At length, argument having run high,
the mule would fain have been content with the
seat reserved for the ass; but even this was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
denied him, and, as a punishment for his presumption,
he was thrust to the lower end, as one
who, instead of meriting consideration, was
nothing but a base mongrel.'</p>

<p>It is said that when &AElig;sop was being taken to the
rock Hyampia, there to be sacrificed, he predicted
that the hand of retributive Justice would smite
his persecutors for their inhumanity; and, reciting
the fable of <i>The Eagle and the Beetle</i>, he warned
them that the weakest may procure vengeance
against the most powerful in requital of injuries
inflicted. 'A hare, being pursued by an eagle,
retreated into the nest of a beetle, who promised
her protection. The eagle repulsed the beetle,
and destroyed the hare before its face. The
beetle, remembering the wrong done it, soared to
the nest of the eagle and destroyed her eggs.
Appealing to Jupiter, the god listened to the petition
of his favourite bird, and granted her leave to
lay her eggs in his lap for safety. The beetle, seeing
this, made a ball of dirt, and, carrying it aloft,
dropped it into the lap of the god, who, forgetting
the eggs, shook all off together.'</p>

<p><i>The Piper turned Fisherman</i> was spoken by
Cyrus (King of Persia) at Sardis to the Ionians
and &AElig;olians on the occasion of their sending
ambassadors, offering to become subject to him
on the same terms as they had been to Cr&#339;sus.
But he, when he heard their proposal, told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
this story: 'A piper seeing some fishes in the sea,
began to pipe, expecting that they would come to
shore; but finding his hopes disappointed, he
took a casting-net, and enclosed a great number
of fishes, and drew them out. When he saw
them leaping about, he said to the fishes: "Cease
your dancing, since when I piped you would not
come out and dance."' Cyrus told this story to
the Ionians and &AElig;olians because the Ionians,
when Cyrus pressed them by his ambassador to
revolt from Cr&#339;sus, refused to consent, and now,
when the business was done, were ready to listen
to him. He therefore, under the influence of anger,
gave them this answer.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The fable of <i>The Horse and the Stag</i> was rehearsed
by Stesichorus to the citizens of Himera<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
with a view to stimulating them to beware of the
encroachments of Phalaris the Tyrant, whom they
had chosen general with absolute powers, and
were on the eve of assigning him a body-guard.
'The stag, with his horns, got the better of the
horse, and drove him clean out of the pasture
where they used to feed together. So the horse
craved the assistance of man; and in order to
receive the benefit of his help, suffered him to
put a bridle on his neck, a bit in his mouth, and a
saddle upon his back. By this means he entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
defeated his enemy. But guess his chagrin when,
returning thanks, and desiring to be dismissed, he
received for answer: "No! I never knew before
how useful a drudge you were; and now that I
have found what you are good for, you may depend
upon it I will keep you to it." Look to it,
then' (continued Stesichorus), 'lest in your wish
to avenge yourselves on your enemies you suffer
in the same way as the horse; for already, through
your choice of a commander with independent
power, you have the bit in your mouths; but if
you assign him a body-guard, and permit him to
mount into the saddle, you will become, from that
moment forth, the slaves of Phalaris.'</p>

<p>When the Athenians, with the ingratitude
which sometimes blinds a whole people to the
merits of their best friends, would have betrayed
Demosthenes into the hands of Philip, King of
Macedonia, the orator, as watch-dog of the
State,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> brought them to a better frame of mind
by a recital of <i>The Wolves and the Sheep</i>. 'Once
on a time, the wolves sent an embassy to the
sheep, desiring that there might be peace between
them for the time to come. "Why," said they,
"should we be for ever waging this deadly strife?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Those wicked dogs are the cause of it all; they
are incessantly barking at us and provoking us;
send them away, and there will no longer be any
obstacle to our eternal friendship and peace."
The silly sheep listened; the dogs were dismissed,
and the flock, thus deprived of their best protectors,
became an easy prey to their treacherous
enemy.'</p>

<p>On another occasion, when the populace were
wrangling and disputing on matters of comparatively
small moment whilst neglecting more important
concerns, the same orator warned them of the
danger they were in of losing the substance in
fighting for the shadow. 'A youth,' said he, 'one
hot summer day, hired an ass to carry him from
Athens to Megara. At mid-day the heat of the
sun was so intense that he dismounted, and sat
down to repose himself in the shadow of the ass.
The driver of the ass thereupon disputed with
him, declaring that he had a better right to the
shade than the other. "What!" said the youth,
"did I not hire the ass for the whole journey?"
"Yes," replied the other, "you hired the ass, but
not the ass's shadow." While they were wrangling
and fighting for the place, the ass took to his
heels and ran away.'</p>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">The</span> 'Panca Tantra' is a collection of Hindoo
fables, the supposed author of which was
Vishnu Sarman, and this is believed to be the
source of 'The Fables of Pilpay' or <i>Bidpa&#299;</i>, which
are undoubtedly of Indian origin. The transformation
which these latter have experienced in
their progress down the ages, chiefly by reason of
their having been translated into the Arabic in
the sixth century under the name of the 'Book of
Kalilah and Dimnah,' and afterwards into other
Eastern languages, has altered their Indian character,
and caused them to assume a Persian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
vesture and significance. They are rich in ripe
wisdom, and prove the insight of their author or
authors into human nature, which in those early
days, and in those far countries, was much as it is
in more westerly communities and in our own
times.</p>

<p>Taking the &AElig;sopian fable as our model, the
bulk of Pilpay's stories are not fables <i>par excellence</i>.
They are more of the nature of <i>rencontres</i> of
adventures, fabulous, it is true, and containing
generally an excellent moral, but elaborated and
complex for the most part; they are wanting in
the terseness, the crispness, and concentration, as
well as in the simplicity and spontaneity, of the
Greek. At the same time there is a freshness
and vigour in these old fables that is not sacrificed
by translation, and they are sufficiently
striking and admirable as moral stories to justify
the repute in which they have always been held.
<i>The Greedy and Ambitious Cat</i> is one of the stories
in the Bidpa&#299; collection.</p>

<p>'There was formerly an old woman in a village,
extremely thin, half starved, and meagre. She
lived in a little cottage as dark and gloomy as a
fool's heart, and withal as close shut up as a
miser's hand.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This miserable creature had for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the companion of her wretched retirement a cat,
meagre and lean as herself; the poor creature
never saw bread nor beheld the face of a stranger,
and was forced to be contented with only smelling
the mice in their holes, or seeing the prints of
their feet in the dust. If by some extraordinary
lucky chance this miserable animal happened to
catch a mouse, she was like a beggar that discovers
a treasure: her visage and her eyes were inflamed
with joy, and that booty served her for a whole
week; and out of the excess of her admiration,
and distrust of her own happiness, she would cry
out to herself, "Heavens! is this a dream, or is
it real?" One day, however, ready to die for
hunger, she got upon the ridge of her enchanted
castle, which had long been the mansion of famine
for cats, and spied from thence another cat, that
was stalking upon a neighbour's wall like a lion,
walking along as if she were counting her steps,
and so fat that she could hardly go. The old
woman's cat, astonished to see a creature of her
own species so plump and so large, with a loud
voice cries out to her pursy neighbour: "In the
name of pity speak to me, thou happiest of the
cat kind! Why, you look as if you came from
one of the Khan of Kathais'<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> feasts; I conjure ye
to tell me how or in what region it is that you get
your skin so well stuffed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>'"Where?" replied the fat one. "Why,
where should one feed well but at a king's table?
I go to the house," continued she, "every day
about dinner-time, and there I lay my paws upon
some delicious morsel or other, which serves me
till the next, and then leave enough for an army of
mice, which under me live in peace and tranquillity;
for why should I commit murder for a
piece of tough and skinny mouse-flesh, when I
can live on venison at a much easier rate?"</p>

<p>'The lean cat, on this, eagerly inquired the way
to this house of plenty, and entreated her plump
neighbour to carry her one day along with her.</p>

<p>'"Most willingly," said the fat puss; "for
thou seest I am naturally charitable, and thou art
so lean that I heartily pity thy condition."</p>

<p>'On this promise they parted, and the lean cat
returned to the old woman's chamber, where she
told her dame the story of what had befallen
her.</p>

<p>'The old woman prudently endeavoured to
dissuade her cat from prosecuting her design,
admonishing her withal to have a care of being
deceived.</p>

<p>'"For, believe me," said she, "the desires of
the ambitious are never to be satiated but when
their mouths are stuffed with the dirt of their
graves. Sobriety and temperance are the only
things that truly enrich people. I must tell thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
poor silly cat, that they who travel to satisfy their
ambition have no knowledge of the good things
they possess, nor are they truly thankful to Heaven
for what they enjoy, who are not contented with
their fortune."</p>

<p>'The poor starved cat, however, had conceived
so fair an idea of the king's table, that the old
woman's good morals and judicious remonstrances
entered in at one ear and went out at the other;
in short, she departed the next day with the fat
puss to go to the king's house; but, alas! before
she got thither her destiny had laid a snare for
her. For, being a house of good cheer, it was so
haunted with cats that the servants had, just at
this time, orders to kill all the cats that came near
it, by reason of a great robbery committed the
night before in the king's larder by several
grimalkins. The old woman's cat, however,
pushed on by hunger, entered the house, and no
sooner saw a dish of meat unobserved by the
cooks, but she made a seizure of it, and was
doing what for many years she had not done
before, that is, heartily filling her belly; but as
she was enjoying herself under the dresser-board,
and feeding heartily upon her stolen morsels, one
of the testy officers of the kitchen, missing his
breakfast, and seeing where the poor cat was
solacing herself with it, threw his knife at her
with such an unlucky hand that it struck her full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in the breast. However, as it has been the providence
of Nature to give this creature nine lives
instead of one, poor puss made a shift to crawl
away, after she had for some time shammed dead;
but in her flight, observing the blood come
streaming from her wound&mdash;"Well," said she,
"let me but escape this accident, and if ever I
quit my old home and my own mice for all the
rarities in the king's kitchen, may I lose all my
nine lives at once!"'</p>

<p>The moral of the story is, that it is better to
be contented with what one has than to travel
in search of what ambition prompts us to seek
for.</p>

<p>In the Escurial, near Madrid, the library of
which is rich in ancient literary treasures, is a
work by Ebn Arabscah, a collection of Arabian
fables. Arabia may with truth be designated the
very fountain-head of fabulous story. It was in
that country that the venerable Locman flourished,
during, it is believed, the reigns of the Jewish
kings David and Solomon. Berington, in his
essay on 'The Arabian or Saracenic Learning,'
remarks that Locman is said to have been an
Ethiopian or Nubian, extremely deformed in his
person, but so famed for wisdom as to have
acquired the appellation of the Sage. His fables
and moral maxims, written for the instruction of
mankind, were in the estimation of the Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
people a gift from heaven, and they received them
as its inspired dictates. 'Heretofore,' says the
Divine being in the Koran, 'we gave wisdom to
Locman.' The same writer suggests whether
Locman and &AElig;sop may not be the same person.
'The history of the two sages is so perfectly
similar in their characters and the incidents of
their lives, that one must have been borrowed
from the other. But the chronological difficulties,'
he adds, 'are sufficiently perplexing.'</p>

<p>We have already seen that the alleged similarity
in character and bodily appearance was due to the
invention or misconception of Planudes, whose
story of &AElig;sop was written in the fourteenth
century, and therefore the seeming identity of the
sages falls to the ground. Moreover, the fables
of &AElig;sop have a mobility about them which we
do not find in those of other fabulists; they are
essentially Attic in their diction, exhibiting all the
marks of that compressed wit and wisdom for
which the ancient Greek mind was distinguished.
Eastern fable, on the other hand, is ornate and
florid, and wanting in the Grecian clear-cut
directness and point. It is idle to assume that
the ideas, if not the diction, may have been
borrowed and clothed in a new dress, unless it can
be shown that the substance or subject-matter of
the fables of the two sages is alike or similar in
character. Granted that a few&mdash;about a dozen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
number<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>&mdash;of the &AElig;sopian fables find their
counterpart in the fables of a more remote
antiquity and in more Eastern countries, this
circumstance might be expected; ideas dating
from the very advent of the human race are
current amongst us in this day, but surely even
we of the nineteenth century have a sufficient
stock of original conceptions to justify our claims
to be considered inventors, and so with &AElig;sop and
the race of fabulists in all ages.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson says,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> with great force and truth,
that 'the fables which appeal to our higher moral
sympathies may sometimes do as much for us as
the truths of science,' and she paraphrases from
Sir William Jones's Persian Grammar a fable
embodying one of those traditions of our Lord
which are preserved in the East.</p>

<p>'Jesus,' says the story, 'arrived one evening at
the gates of a certain city, and He sent His
disciples forward to prepare supper, while He
Himself, intent on doing good, walked through
the streets into the market place.</p>

<p>'And He saw at the corner of the market some
people gathered together looking at an object on
the ground; and He drew near to see what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
might be. It was a dead dog with a halter round
his neck, by which he appeared to have been
dragged through the dirt; and a viler, more
abject, a more unclean thing never met the eyes
of man.</p>

<p>'And those who stood by looked on with
abhorrence.</p>

<p>'"Faugh!" said one, stopping his nose, "it
pollutes the air." "How long," said another,
"shall this foul beast offend our sight?" "Look
at his torn hide," said a third; "one could not
even cut a shoe out of it." "And his ears," said
a fourth, "all draggled and bleeding!" "No
doubt," said a fifth, "he hath been hanged for
thieving!"</p>

<p>'And Jesus heard them, and looking down
compassionately on the dead creature, He said,
"Pearls are not equal to the whiteness of his
teeth!"</p>

<p>'Then the people turned towards Him with
amazement, and said among themselves, "Who is
this? this must be Jesus of Nazareth, for only
<i>He</i> could find something to pity and approve even
in a dead dog!" And being ashamed, they bowed
their heads before Him, and went each on his
way.'</p>

<p>'I can recall,' continues Mrs. Jameson, 'at
this hour, the vivid, yet softening and pathetic,
impression left on my fancy by this old Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
story. It struck me as exquisitely humorous, as
well as exquisitely beautiful. It gave me a pain
in my conscience, for it seemed thenceforward so
easy and so vulgar to say satirical things, and so
much nobler to be benign and merciful; and I took
the lesson so home that I was in great danger of
falling into the opposite extreme; of seeking the
beautiful even in the midst of the corrupt and the
repulsive. Pity, a large element in my composition,
might have easily degenerated into weakness,
threatening to subvert hatred of evil in trying
to find excuses for it; and whether my mind
has ever completely righted itself, I am not
sure.'</p>

<p>Our remarks on the fables of Pilpay are equally
applicable to the 'Gesta Romanorum' or 'Entertaining
Moral Stories' invented by the monks as
a fireside recreation in the Middle Ages. Most of
them are recitals of adventures rather than fables.
They are believed to be of English origin, though
a similar 'Gesta,' composed of stories in imitation
of them, appeared in Germany about the same
time. The taste displayed in many of them is of
a questionable kind, and an outrageous twist is
often given to their application; though doubtless
they are a truthful reflex of the ideas and manners
of the age in which they were composed and
rehearsed, and in that respect they are of the
utmost interest and value. Most of the fables or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
tales in the 'Gesta' begin well, and with a promise
of interest. This interest, it must be said, is
rarely maintained, for, as a rule, their conclusion
is insipid, and sometimes inane. This notwithstanding,
they are valuable by reason of their
suggestiveness. The two examples we quote,
translated from the Latin by the Rev. Charles
Swan, are not faultless, but they are coherent
throughout, and have a rounded literary finish in
which many of the others are wanting. The first
is entitled <i>Of Perfect Life</i>:</p>

<p>'When Titus was Emperor of Rome, he made
a decree that the natal day of his first-born son
should be held sacred, and that whosoever
violated it by any kind of labour should be put to
death. This edict being promulgated, he called
Virgil, the learned man, to him, and said, "Good
friend, I have established a certain law, but as
offences may frequently be committed without
being discovered by the ministers of justice, I
desire you to frame some curious piece of art
which may reveal to me every transgressor of the
law." Virgil replied, "Sire, your will shall be
accomplished." He straightway constructed a
magic statue, and caused it to be erected in the
midst of the city. By virtue of the secret powers
with which it was invested, it communicated to
the Emperor whatever offences were committed in
secret on that day. And thus, by the accusation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the statue, an infinite number of persons were
convicted.</p>

<p>'Now, there was a certain carpenter, called
Focus, who pursued his occupation every day
alike. Once, as he lay in his bed, his thoughts
turned upon the accusations of the statue, and the
multitudes which it had caused to perish. In the
morning he clothed himself, and proceeded to
the statue, which he addressed in the following
manner: "O statue! statue! because of thy
informations, many of our citizens have been
apprehended and slain. I vow to my God that,
if thou accusest me, I will break thy head."
Having so said, he returned home. About the
first hour, the Emperor, as he was wont,
despatched sundry messengers to the statue to
inquire if the edict had been strictly complied
with. After they had arrived and delivered the
Emperor's pleasure, the statue exclaimed, "Friends,
look up: what see ye written upon my forehead?"
They looked, and beheld three sentences, which
ran thus: "Times are altered. Men grow worse.
He who speaks truth will have his head broken."
"Go," said the statue; "declare to his majesty
what you have seen and read." The messengers
obeyed, and detailed the circumstances as they
had happened.</p>

<p>'The Emperor thereupon commanded his guard
to arm, and march to the place on which the statue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
was erected; and he further ordered that, if any
one presumed to molest it, they should bind him
hand and foot and drag him into his presence.
The soldiers approached the statue, and said:
"Our Emperor wills you to declare who have
broken the law, and who they are that threatened
you." The statue made answer, "Seize Focus,
the carpenter! Every day he violates the law,
and, moreover, menaces me." Immediately Focus
was apprehended and conducted to the Emperor,
who said, "Friend, what do I hear of thee?
Why dost thou break my law?" "My lord,"
answered Focus, "I cannot keep it; for I am
obliged to obtain every day eight pennies, which,
without incessant labour, I have not the means of
acquiring." "And why eight pennies?" said the
Emperor. "Every day through the year," returned
the carpenter, "I am bound to repay two
pennies which I borrowed in my youth; two I
lend; two I lose; and two I spend." "You
must make this more clear," said the Emperor.
"My lord," he replied, "listen to me. I am
bound each day to repay two pennies to my
father; for when I was a boy my father expended
upon me daily the like sum. Now he is poor,
and needs my assistance, and therefore I return
what I borrowed formerly. Two other pennies I
lend to my son, who is pursuing his studies, in
order that, if by any chance I should fall into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
poverty, he may restore the loan, just as I have
done to his grandfather. Again, I lose two
pennies every day on my wife; for she is contradictious,
wilful, and passionate. Now, because of
this disposition, I account whatsoever is given to
her entirely lost. Lastly, two other pennies I
expend upon myself in meat and drink, I cannot
do with less; nor can I obtain them without unremitting
labour. You now know the truth, and I
pray you give a righteous judgment." "Friend,"
said the Emperor, "thou hast answered well.
Go, and labour earnestly in thy calling." Soon
after this the Emperor died, and Focus the
carpenter, on account of his singular wisdom, was
elected in his stead, by the unanimous choice of
the whole nation. He governed as wisely as he
had lived; and at his death his picture, bearing
on the head eight pennies, was reposited among
the effigies of the deceased Emperors.</p>

<p>'Application: My beloved, the Emperor is God,
who appointed Sunday as a day of rest. By
Virgil is typified the Holy Spirit, which ordains
a preacher to declare men's virtues and vices.
Focus is any good Christian who labours diligently
in his vocation, and performs faithfully every
relative duty.'</p>

<p>The story has point and humour, but in the
latter quality it is surpassed by the next one,
entitled <i>Confession</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>'A certain Emperor, named Asmodeus, established
an ordinance, by which every malefactor
taken and brought before the judge should, if he
distinctly declared three truths, against which
no exception could be taken, obtain his life and
property. It chanced that a certain soldier transgressed
the law and fled. He hid himself in a
forest, and there committed many atrocities,
despoiling and slaying whomsoever he could lay
his hands upon. When the judge of the district
ascertained his haunt, he ordered the forest to be
surrounded, and the soldier to be seized and
brought bound to the seat of judgment. "You
know the law," said the judge. "I do," returned
the other: "If I declare three unquestionable
truths, I shall be free; but if not, I must die."
"True," replied the judge; "take, then, advantage
of the law's clemency, or this very day you shall
not taste food until you are hanged." "Cause
silence to be kept," said the soldier. His wish
being complied with, he proceeded in the following
manner. "The first truth is this: I protest
before ye all, that from my youth up I have been
a bad man." The judge, hearing this, said to
the bystanders: "He says true, else he had not
now been in this situation. Go on, then," continued
the judge; "what is the second truth?"
"I like not," exclaimed he, "the dangerous situation
in which I stand." "Certainly," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
judge, "we may credit thee. Now then for the
third truth, and thou hast saved thy life." "Why,"
he replied, "if I once get out of this confounded
place, I will never willingly re-enter it." "Amen,"
said the judge, "thy wit hath preserved thee; go
in peace." And thus he was saved.</p>

<p>'Application: My beloved, the emperor is
Christ. The soldier is any sinner; the judge is a
wise confessor. If the sinner confess the truth in
such a manner as not even demons can object, he
shall be saved; that is, if he confess and repent.'</p>

<p>The 'Gesta' is a rich storehouse from which
many poets, including Gower, Chaucer, Spenser,
Shakespeare, Parnell, and others, have borrowed.
Shakespeare's 'Pericles' has its source in the
'Gesta'; so also Parnell's delightful poem, 'The
Hermit,' and Dr. John Byrom's 'Three Black
Crows' are from the same prolific treasure-house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<small>MODERN FABULISTS: LA FONTAINE, GAY.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Lie gently on their ashes, gentle earth.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Beaumont and Fletcher.</span></p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">It</span> is a remarkable circumstance in connection
with the literature of fable, that those who
have excelled in it are comparatively few. The
principal names that occur to us are &AElig;sop, La
Fontaine, Gay, Lessing, Krilof; 'the rest are all
but leather or prunello,' if we except a few rare
examples from Northcote and Cowper. The composition
of fables seems to call for the exercise of a
talent which is peculiar and rare. La Fontaine
says<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> that the writing of apologues is a gift sent
down from the immortals. Not even those who
have practised the art have always succeeded in
it to perfection. Gay, who is esteemed the best
of the English fabulists, is often prolix and lacking
in point. La Fontaine, sprightly as are his
renderings of the ancient fables which he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
ready to his hand, is weak and commonplace in
his attempts at originality. Dodsley is too
didactic and goody-goody; Northcote is stilted,
and often unnatural. Even Krilof, admirable as
he generally is, is sometimes darkly obscure, and
his moral difficult to find. Lessing comes nearest
to the terseness and concentration of the &AElig;sopian
model, but many of his so-called fables are better
described as epigrams and witticisms. True, all
these writers have sometimes, like the Phrygian,
'hit the mark,' but oftener they have missed not
only the bull's-eye, but the target itself; and the
arrows of their satire are frequently lost in the
mazes of verbiage. &AElig;sop alone is in the fable
what Shakespeare is in the drama, a paragon
without a peer, and all competitors with either of
these master minds must be content to take a
lower place&mdash;to stand on a lower plane.</p>

<p>Excellent as many modern fables fare, full of
instruction and entertainment, it is but few of
them that spontaneously recur to us in connection
with the affairs of daily life.</p>

<p>Amongst modern fabulists, La Fontaine stands
in the front rank. Jean de la Fontaine was born
at Chateau-Thierry on July 8, 1621; died in
Paris, March 15, 1695,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> in his seventy-fourth
year; and was buried in the cemetery of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Joseph, near the remains of his friend Moli&egrave;re.
He was one of the galaxy of great men and
writers that adorned the age of Louis XIV. His
fables, as is well known, are in verse, and include
the best of those from ancient sources, with others
of his own invention. He may be said to have
turned &AElig;sop into rhyme. The happy spirit of
the genial Frenchman inspires them all. They
are written with a vivacity and sprightliness all
his own, and these qualities, with the humour
which he infuses into them, make their perusal
exhilarating and health-giving.</p>

<p>'I have considered,' says he, 'that as these
fables are already known to all the world, I should
have done nothing if I had not rendered them in
some degree new, by clothing them with certain
fresh characteristics. I have endeavoured to meet
the wants of the day, which are novelty and
gaiety; and by gaiety I do not mean merely that
which excites laughter, but a certain charm, an
agreeable air, which may be given to every species
of subject, even the most serious.'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> He had
attained to middle age before he found his true
vocation in literature, his first collection of fables
in six books being published in 1668, when he was
forty-seven years of age.</p>

<p>La Fontaine is well known in this country by
the English translations of his work. A version<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
containing some of his best fables was published
anonymously in 1820, but is known to be from the
pen of John Matthews of Herefordshire. In his
preface, Matthews states that the fables are not
altogether a translation or an imitation of La
Fontaine, because in most of them are allusions
to public characters and the events of the times,
where they are suggested by the subject. These
allusions are largely political. The fables, apart
from these ephemeral references to personages
and events, are written with great cleverness and
vivacity, full of humour, and in many instances are
well suited for recitation.</p>

<p><i>The Fox and the Stork</i> is a good example of his
style:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'For sport once Renard, sly old sinner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press'd gossip Stork to share his dinner.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Neighbour, I must entreat you'll stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take your soup with me to-day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My praise shall not my fare enhance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let me beg you'll take your chance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You're kindly welcome were it better."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She yielded as he thus beset her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon arrived the pottage smoking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In plates of shallow depth provoking.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas vain the guest essay'd to fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unsubstantial fare her bill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas vain she fish'd to find a collop,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The host soon lapp'd the liquor all up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dame Stork conceal'd her deep displeasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thought to find revenge at leisure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Ere long, my friend, you'll try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My humble hospitality.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I know your taste, and we'll contrive&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow I'm at home at five."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With punctual haste the wily scoffer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accepts his neighbour's friendly offer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ent'ring cries, "Dear Stork, how is it?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see I soon return your visit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can't resist when you invite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've brought a famous appetite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steam which issues from your kitchen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proves that your pot there's something rich in."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Stork with civil welcome greeted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon at table they were seated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo! there came upon the board<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hash'd goose in two tall pitchers pour'd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pitchers whose long and narrow neck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sly Renard's jaws completely check,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst the gay hostess, much diverted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bill with perfect ease inserted.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fox, half mad at this retorter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought dinner in some other quarter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoaxers, for you this tale is written,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn hence that biters may be bitten.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Matthews adds this note: '<i>Hoaxers, for you, this
tale is written.</i> The word "hoax," though sufficiently
expressive, and admitted into general use, has
not, perhaps, found its way into the dictionaries.
It is, however, of some importance, as it serves in
some measure to characterize the times we live
in. Former periods have been distinguished by
the epithets golden, silver, brazen, iron. Notwithstanding
the multiplicity of metals which
chemistry has now discovered, none of them may
be sufficiently descriptive of the manners of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in these days. Quitting, therefore, the ancient
mode of classification, the present may not be
unaptly designated the hoaxing age. The term
deserves a definition. A hoax may be said to be
<i>a practical joke, calculated more or less to injure its
object, sometimes accompanied by a high degree of
criminality</i>. This definition, which is much at the
service of future English lexicographers, includes
not only the minor essays of mischievous humour,
which assembles all the schoolmasters of the
Metropolis at one house; the medical professors
and undertakers at another; the milliners, mantua-makers,
and mercers at a third; whilst the street
before the victim's door is blocked up by grand
pianofortes, Grecian couches, caravans of wild
beasts, and patent coffins; but also the more
sublime strokes of genius, which would acquire
sudden wealth by throwing Change Alley into an
uproar&mdash;which would gain excessive popularity
by gulling the English people with a show of
mock patriotism&mdash;which can make bankrupts in
fortune and reputation leaders of thousands and
tens of thousands, so as to threaten destruction to
the State. The performers of all these notable
exploits may be denominated hoaxers, most of
whom may, in the end, find themselves involved
in the predicament expressed in the concluding
couplet of the fable.'</p>

<p>We are tempted to give another very fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
example from Matthews, containing as it does
an interesting reference to the two mighty men of
letters of the first quarter of the present century&mdash;<i>The
Viper and the File:</i></p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A Viper chanc'd his head to pop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a neighbouring blacksmith's shop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long near the place had he been lurking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stayed till past the hours for working.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with keen eyes he glanc'd around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In search of food, a File he found:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of meats he saw no single item<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which tempted hungry jaws to bite 'em.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So with his fangs the eager fool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attack'd the rough impassive tool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whilst his wounded palate bled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fancied on foreign gore he fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When thus the File retorted coolly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Viper! this work's ingenious, truly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more those idle efforts try;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proof 'gainst assaults like yours am I.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Thus did a Poet,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> vain and young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Who since has palinody sung),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fangs upon a Minstrel's lay<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fix hard. 'Twas labour thrown away!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that sweet Bard of Doric strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This venom'd bite was tried in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His flights, thro' no dark medium view'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Derive from fog no magnitude;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But bright and clear to charm our eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vivid pictures boldly rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In painting manners, arms, and dress, sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time show'd him all his form and pressure.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bard of the North! thou still shalt be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A File to Critics, harsh as he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho' Time has teeth, thou need'st not fear 'em;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy verse defies old Edax Rerum!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It must be confessed that the general moral
here is not very obvious, though the special application
of the fable to the circumstances of Byron's
attack on Scott, and his subsequent recantation&mdash;with
the fabulist's eulogy of the 'Bard of the
North'&mdash;are expressed in charming and faultless
verse.</p>

<p>John Gay, who was born in the parish of
Landkey, near Barnstaple, Devonshire, in 1685,
and died in London, on December 4, 1732, aged
forty-seven, is, without question, the best of the
English fabulists. Unlike most writers in this
department of literature, his fables are almost all
original. His language is choice and elegant, yet
well suited to his subject. His rhymes are perfect,
and at times he almost rises into poetry. His
fables, however, are lacking in humour, and they
have not that abounding <i>esprit</i> and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> which
characterize La Fontaine.</p>

<p>Gay was a writer of much industry,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> producing
during his lifetime almost every species of composition.
His 'Beggar's Opera' is yet occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
seen on the stage, and this, after his fables,
is his best-known work.</p>

<p>He was essentially Bohemian in disposition and
habits, and lacking in business capacity; a man
of culture, however, a pleasant companion, and a
warm-hearted friend. He was on intimate terms
with Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and other distinguished
men of letters and wits of his day, and
the eccentric but kind-hearted Duchess of Queensberry
was his patron and friend. Unfortunately,
he was too much given to dangling at the skirts
of the great, and sueing for place at Court instead
of depending on his own genius, which was
unquestionably of no mean order. Notwithstanding
this failing, he was no sycophant or
flatterer, but exposed the follies and vices of
human nature, as exemplified in the characters of
the rich and great, as in those of the humbler
ranks, without fear or favour. His best-known
fables are probably <i>The Hare and many Friends</i>,
and <i>The Miser and Plutus</i>.</p>

<p>Many of Gay's lines, both from his fables and
plays, have become widely popular, for example:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Princes, like beauties, from their youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are strangers to the voice of truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn to contemn all praise betimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Flattery's the nurse of crimes.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'In every age and clime we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two of a trade can ne'er agree.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'While there's life there's hope.'<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Those who in quarrels interpose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must often wipe a bloody nose.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When a lady's in the case<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know all other things give place.'<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">''Tis woman that seduces all mankind.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'How happy could I be with either<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were t'other dear charmer away.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">And his own epitaph, written by himself:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Life's a jest, and all things show it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought so once, and now I know it.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the letter to Pope in which this distich is
given, he says: 'If anybody should ask how I
could communicate this after death, let it be
known it is not meant so, but my present sentiments
in life.'</p>

<p>Gay was buried in Westminster Abbey. The
monument which marks his grave bears the well-known
lines composed by Pope:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Of manners gentle, of Affections mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wit a Man, simplicity, a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With native Humour, temp'ring Virtuous Rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Formed to delight at once and lash the Age:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above Temptation in a low Estate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And uncorrupted, e'en among the great.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A safe Companion, and an easy Friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unblam'd thro' life, lamented in thy End.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are thy Honours! Not that here thy Bust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is mix'd with Heroes, or with Kings thy Dust:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But that the Worthy and the Good shall say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striking their pensive bosoms,&mdash;here lies Gay.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The piece we have selected, <i>The Miser and
Plutus</i>, as an example of his work as a fabulist, is
in his best style, and the moral is irreproachable:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'The wind was high, the window shakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sudden start the Miser wakes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the silent room he stalks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks back, and trembles as he walks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each lock and every bolt he tries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every creek and corner pries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then opes the chest with treasure stor'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stands in rapture o'er his hoard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now with sudden qualms possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wrings his hands, he beats his breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By conscience stung he wildly stares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus his guilty soul declares:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Had the deep earth her stores confin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This heart had known sweet peace of mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But virtue's sold. Good gods! what price<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can recompense the pangs of vice?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O bane of good! seducing cheat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can man, weak man, thy power defeat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold banish'd honour from the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only left the name behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold sow'd the world with every ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold taught the murderer's sword to kill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas gold instructed coward hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In treachery's more pernicious arts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can recount the mischiefs o'er?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue resides on earth no more!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke, and sighed. In angry mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plutus, his god, before him stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Miser, trembling, locked his chest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Vision frowned, and thus address'd:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="i2">"Whence is this vile ungrateful rant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each sordid rascal's daily cant?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I, base wretch! corrupt mankind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fault's in thy rapacious mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because my blessings are abused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must I be censur'd, curs'd, accus'd?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n virtue's self by knaves is made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloak to carry on the trade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And power (when lodg'd in their possession)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows tyranny, and rank oppression.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus when the villain crams his chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold is the canker of the breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis avarice, insolence, and pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ev'ry shocking vice beside;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when to virtuous hands 'tis given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It blesses, like the dews of Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Heaven, it hears the orphan's cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wipes the tears from widows' eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their crimes on gold shall misers lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who pawn'd their sordid souls for pay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let bravos, then, when blood is spilt,<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<small>MODERN FABULISTS: DODSLEY, NORTHCOTE.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A tale may find him who a sermon flies.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">George Herbert.</span></p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">Robert Dodsley</span>, born at Mansfield,
Nottinghamshire, in 1703, died at Durham,
December 25, 1764, buried in the abbey churchyard
there, author of 'The Economy of Human
Life' and other estimable works, compiled a
volume of fables (1761). This was the favourite
collection in this country at the end of last and
the beginning of the present century. The
contents of the volume are in three parts, and
comprise 'Ancient Fables,' 'Modern Fables,' and
'Fables Newly Invented.' The first two divisions
of the volume are &AElig;sopian in character. The
fables contained in the last were not all written
by Dodsley, some of them being contributed, as
he states in his preface, 'by authors with whom
it is an honour to be connected, and who having
condescended to favour him with their assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
have given him an opportunity of making some
atonement for his own defects.' It is to be regretted
that he did not give the names of the
authors referred to. The work contains a life of
&AElig;sop 'by a learned friend' (no name given),<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
and an excellent, though somewhat pedantic,
'Essay on Fable.'</p>

<p>The following are three original fables from
Dodsley's collection:</p>

<p>'<i>The Miser and the Magpie.</i>&mdash;As a miser sat at
his desk counting over his heaps of gold, a magpie
eloped from his cage, picked up a guinea, and
hopped away with it. The miser, who never failed to
count his money over a second time, immediately
missed the piece, and rising up from his seat in the
utmost consternation, observed the felon hiding it in
a crevice of the floor. "And art thou," cried he,
"that worst of thieves, who hast robbed me of my
gold without the plea of necessity, and without
regard to its proper use? But thy life shall atone
for so preposterous a villainy." "Soft words, good
master!" quoth the magpie. "Have I, then, injured
you in any other sense than you defraud the
public? And am I not using your money in the
same manner you do yourself? If I must lose
my life for hiding a single guinea, what do you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
I pray, deserve, who secrete so many thousands?"'</p>

<p>'<i>The Toad and the Ephemeron.</i>&mdash;As some workmen
were digging in a mountain of Scythia, they
discerned a toad of enormous size in the midst of
a solid rock. They were very much surprised at
so uncommon an appearance, and the more they
considered the circumstances of it, the more their
wonder increased. It was hard to conceive by
what means the creature had preserved life and
received nourishment in so narrow a prison, and
still more difficult to account for his birth and
existence in a place so totally inaccessible to all
of his species. They could conclude no other
than that he was formed together with the rock
in which he had been bred, and was coeval with
the mountain itself. While they were pursuing
these speculations, the toad sat swelling and
bloating till he was ready to burst with pride and
self-importance, to which at last he thus gave vent:
"Yes," says he, "you behold in me a specimen of
the antediluvian race of animals. I was begotten
before the flood; and who is there among the
present upstart race of mortals that shall dare to
contend with me in nobility of birth or dignity of
character?" An ephemeron, sprung that morning
from the river Hypanis, as he was flying about
from place to place, chanced to be present, and
observed all that passed with great attention and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
curiosity. "Vain boaster," says he, "what
foundation hast thou for pride, either in thy
descent, merely because it is ancient, or thy life,
because it hath been long? What good qualities
hast thou received from thy ancestors? Insignificant
even to thyself, as well as useless to others,
thou art almost as insensible as the block in which
thou wast bred. Even I, that had my birth only
from the scum of the neighbouring river, at the
rising of this day's sun, and who shall die at
its setting, have more reason to applaud my condition
than thou hast to be proud of thine. I
have enjoyed the warmth of the sun, the light of
the day, and the purity of the air; I have flown
from stream to stream, from tree to tree, and
from the plain to the mountain; I have provided
for posterity, and shall leave behind me a numerous
offspring to people the next age of to-morrow; in
short, I have fulfilled all the ends of my being,
and I have been happy. My whole life, 'tis true,
is but of twelve hours, but even one hour of it is
to be preferred to a thousand years of mere existence,
which have been spent, like thine, in sloth,
ignorance and stupidity."'</p>

<p>'<i>The Bee and the Spider.</i>&mdash;On the leaves and
flowers of the same shrub, a spider and a bee pursued
their several occupations, the one covering
her thighs with honey, the other distending his
bag with poison. The spider, as he glanced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
eye obliquely at the bee, was ruminating with
spleen on the superiority of her productions.
"And how happens it," said he, in a peevish tone,
"that I am able to collect nothing but poison
from the selfsame plant that supplies thee with
honey? My pains and industry are not less than
thine; in those respects we are each indefatigable."
"It proceeds only," replied the bee, "from the
different disposition of our nature; mine gives
a pleasing flavour to everything I touch, whereas
thine converts to poison what by a different
process had been the purest honey."'</p>

<p>James Northcote, R.A., the indefatigable painter,
who, when a youth, enjoyed the friendship of Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and was occasionally one of the
company at his hospitable table, along with
Johnson, Goldsmith, Burke, Garrick and Boswell,
published two volumes of original and selected
fables in 1828-33, when he was eighty-two years
of age. When a boy, living at Plymouth, where
he was born on October 22, 1746, he took pleasure
in copying the pictures from an edition of &AElig;sop's
fables. The memory of these clung to him
through life, and, as occasion offered, he occupied
himself in composing apologues in imitation of
those with which he was familiar in his early
years.</p>

<p>The diction of Northcote's fables is admirable.
They are in the choicest phraseology, both in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
their verse and prose, for he practised both
forms of composition, though chiefly the latter.
Neither crisp nor brilliant, they are now and
again lighted up with scintillations of humour.
His applications are delivered with grave
solemnity befitting a judge or a philosopher&mdash;not
to say a bore; and in many instances they
extend to three or four times the length of the
fable itself.</p>

<p>Northcote died in London at the ripe age
of eighty-five, and was buried beneath the New
Church of St. Marylebone.</p>

<p>Perhaps his best fables are <i>The Jay and the Owl</i>,
<i>Echo and the Parrot</i>, <i>Stone Broth</i>, and <i>The Trooper
and his Armour</i>. None of Northcote's fables have
become popular with the multitude, though many
of them are good examples of this class of composition.
We give the last-named piece as a
specimen of his work as a fabulist. The application
is well conceived, but it is scarcely indicated
in the fable:</p>

<p>'A trooper, in the time of battle, picked up the
shoe of a horse that lay in his way, and quickly
by a cord suspended it from his neck. Soon
after, in a skirmish with the enemy, a shot struck
exactly on the said horseshoe and saved his life,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
as it fell harmless to the ground. "Well done,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
said the trooper, "I see that a very little armour
is sufficient when it is well placed."</p>

<p>'Application: Although the trooper's good
luck with his bit of armour may appear to be the
effect of chance, yet certain it is that prudent persons
are always prepared to receive good fortune,
or may be said to meet it half-way, turning every
accident if possible to good, which gives an
appearance as if they were the favourites of fortune;
whilst the thoughtless and improvident, on
the contrary, often neglect to embrace the very
blessings which chance throws in their way, and
then survey with envy those who prosper by their
careful and judicious conduct, and blame their
partial or hard fortune for all those privations and
sufferings which their mismanagement alone has
brought upon themselves.'</p>

<small>MODERN FABULISTS: LESSING, YRIARTE, KRILOF.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Great thoughts, great feelings, come to them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like instincts, unawares.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">R. M. Milnes.</span></p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">Gotthold Ephraim Lessing</span>, born
January 22, 1729, at Kamenz, died February
15, 1781, aged fifty-two years, was a
distinguished German scholar, poet and dramatist.
As a fabulist, Lessing is noted for epigrammatic
point rather than humour, though he is by no
means lacking in the latter characteristic. He is
perhaps the most original writer of fables amongst
the moderns. Sagacious, wise, witty, his apologues
(1759) have nothing superfluous about them. They
are nearly all brief, pithy, and very much to the
point. In these respects they follow the &AElig;sopian
model more than those of any other modern writer.
The following are good examples of his style:</p>

<p>'<i>&AElig;sop and the Ass.</i>&mdash;"The next time you write a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
fable about me," said the donkey to &AElig;sop, "make
me say something wise and sensible."</p>

<p>'"Something sensible from you!" exclaimed
&AElig;sop; "what would the world think? People
would call you the sage, and me the donkey!"</p>

<p>'<i>The Shepherd and the Nightingale.</i>&mdash;"Sing to me,
dearest nightingale," said a shepherd to the silent
songstress one beautiful spring evening.</p>

<p>'"Alas!" said the nightingale, "the frogs make
so much noise that I have no inclination to sing.
Do you not hear them?"</p>

<p>'"Undoubtedly I hear them," replied the shepherd,
"but it is owing to your silence."</p>

<p>'<i>Solomon's Ghost.</i>&mdash;A venerable old man, despite
his years and the heat of the day, was ploughing
his field with his own hand, and sowing the grain in
the willing earth, in anticipation of the harvest it
would produce.</p>

<p>'Suddenly, beneath the deep shadow of a
spreading oak, a divine apparition stood before
him! The old man was seized with affright.</p>

<p>'"I am Solomon," said the phantom encouragingly,
"what dost thou here, old friend?"</p>

<p>'"If thou art Solomon," said the owner of the
field, "how canst thou ask? In my youth I learnt
from the ant to be industrious and to accumulate
wealth. That which I then learnt I now practise."</p>

<p>'"Thou hast learnt but half of thy lesson,"
pursued the spirit. "Go once more to the ant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and she will teach thee to rest in the winter of
thy existence, and enjoy what thou hast earned."'</p>

<p>Don Tomas de Yriarte, or Iriarte, a Spanish
fabulist of the eighteenth century, born at Teneriffe
in 1750, is held in much esteem by cultured readers
in Spain. His 'Fabulas Literarias,' or Literary
Fables (1782), sixty-seven in all, and mostly
original, were written with a view to inculcating
literary truths. In other words, their object was
to praise or censure literary work according to its
supposed deserts. Their moral or application is
therefore limited in scope; they do not touch
human nature as a whole, and being thus restricted
in their range, they are deficient in general
interest and value. Obviously, however, it is
possible to give a wider application to the truths
enforced in the apologues, and this is sometimes
done by omitting the special moral supplied by the
writer. Yriarte's versification is graceful and
sprightly, 'combining the exquisite simplicity of
the old Spanish romances and songs with the
true spirit of &AElig;sopian fable;'<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> some of them are
composed in the redondilla measure much affected
by the lyrical poets of Spain, and please by their
style quite as much as by their intrinsic merits.
Yriarte died in 1791. We select the piece which
follows to illustrate his skill as a fabulist:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<h3>'<i>The Two Thrushes.</i></h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A sage old thrush was once discipling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His grandson thrush, a hair-brained stripling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the purveying art. He knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, where vines in plenty grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fruit delicious when he'd come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might attack <i>ad libitum</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Ha!" said the young one, "where's this vine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let's see this fruit you think so fine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Come then, my child, your fortune's great; you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can't conceive what feasts await you!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and gliding through the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They reached a vine, and halted there.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Soon as the grapes the youngster spied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is this the fruit you praise?" he cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, an old bird, sir, as you are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should judge, I think, more wisely far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to admire, or hold as good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such half-grown, small, and worthless food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, see a fruit which I possess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In yonder garden; you'll confess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you behold it, that it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bigger and better far than this."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'll go," he said; "but ere I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This fruit of yours, whate'er it be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm sure it is not worth a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or grape-skin from my vines alone."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They reached the spot the thrushlet named,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he triumphantly exclaimed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Show me the fruit to equal mine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A size so great, a shape so fine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What luxury, however rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can e'en your grapes with this compare?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old bird stared, as well he might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lo! a pumpkin met his sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, that a thrush should take this fancy<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Without much marvelling I can see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it is truly monstrous when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men, who are held as learned men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All books, whatever they be, despise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless of largest bulk and size.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A book is great, if good at all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If bad, it cannot be too small.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ivan Andreivitch Krilof, or Krilov, the Russian,
who was born in Moscow, February 2, 1768, O.S.,
and died in St. Petersburg on November 9, 1844,
aged seventy-six years, was one of the greatest
original fabulists of modern times. One writer
(an Englishman) goes so far as to claim for him
the position of 'the crowned King of the fabulists
of all languages.' His published fables
amount altogether to two hundred and two, of
which thirty-five only are borrowed, the rest being
original. They are in rhymed verse in the Russian,
and an English translation, also in verse, and with
a close adherence to the text in the original, has
been made by Mr. J. Henry Harrison.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> An excellent
prose translation, with a life of Krilof, by
the late Mr. W. R. S. Ralston, M.A., was published
in 1868.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Krilof is characterized by rich common sense
and sound judgment, a rare vein of satire and
an excellent humour. He indeed brims over with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
sarcastic humour. A kind of rugged directness
of language, well calculated to undermine the
shams and abuses at which he aimed, also distinguishes
his apologues. He deserves to be
better known in this country.</p>

<p>Krilof was a journalist, and wrote a number of
dramas, both in tragedy and comedy, before turning
his attention to fables. It is on these latter
that his claim to distinction rests. He rose to
high eminence in his native country, where his
name is a household word; he was patronized
by royalty, and beloved by the common people,
and at his death a monument to his memory was
erected in the Summer Garden at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The following translation of Krilof's beautiful
fable of <i>The Leaves and the Roots</i> is from a brilliant
article in <i>Fraser's Magazine</i> for February, 1839:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">''Twas on a sunny summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting in the flickering shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cast athwart the greensward glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaves, a fluttering host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus 'gan their worth to boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to each other say:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Is it not we<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That deck the tree&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its stem and branches all array<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In verdant pomp and vigorous grace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deprived of us, how altered were their case!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it not we who form the grateful screen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of foliage and luxuriant green,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Welcome to traveller and to swain?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes! we may be deem&eacute;d vain,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But we it is whose charms invite<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Youths and maidens to the grove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we it is, too, who at night<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shelter in her retired alcove<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The songstress of the woods, whose strain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wafts music over dale and plain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In us the zephyrs most rejoice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our emerald beauty to caress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On silken wings they fondly press!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Most true; but yet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You ought not to forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We too exist," replied a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That issued from the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We sure possess some little worth."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And who are ye? where do ye grow?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Buried are we here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the ground. 'Tis we who nourish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stem and you, and make you flourish:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For understand, we are the roots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whom the tree itself upshoots:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis we by whom you thrive&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whom your beauty ye derive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlike to you, we are not fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor dwell we in the upper air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet do we not, like you, decay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winter tears us not away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye fall, yet still remains the tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But should it chance that <i>we</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once cease to live, adieu<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both to the tree, fair leaves, and you!"'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As an example of his ironical humour we give
a prose translation, by Mr. Ralston, of his fable
<i>The Geese</i>:</p>

<p>'A peasant, with a long rod in his hand, was
driving some geese to a town where they were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
be sold; and, to tell the truth, he did not treat
them over-politely. In hopes of making a good
bargain, he was hastening on so as not to lose
the market-day (and when gain is concerned,
geese and men alike are apt to suffer). I do not
blame the peasant; but the geese talked about
him in a different spirit, and, whenever they met
any passers-by, abused him to them in such terms
as these:</p>

<p>'"Is it possible to find any geese more unfortunate
than we are? This moujik<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> harasses
us so terribly, and chases us about just as if we
were common geese. The ignoramus does not
know that he ought to pay us reverence, seeing
that we are the noble descendants of those geese
to whom Rome was once indebted for her salvation,
and in whose honour even feast-days were
specially appointed there."</p>

<p>'"And do you want to have honour paid you
on that account?" a passer-by asked them.</p>

<p>'"Why, our ancestors&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"I know that&mdash;I have read all about it; but
I want to know this: of what use have you been
yourselves?"</p>

<p>'"Why, our ancestors saved Rome!"</p>

<p>'"Quite so; but what have you done?"</p>

<p>'"We? Nothing."</p>

<p>'"Then, what merit is there in you? Let your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
ancestors rest in peace&mdash;they justly received
honourable reward; but you, my friends, are
only fit to be roasted!"'</p>

<p>Krilof concludes: 'It would be easy to make
this fable still more intelligible; but I am afraid
of irritating the geese.'</p>

<p>A story, rather than a fable, is <i>The Man with
Three Wives</i>, and the moral underlying it is in the
author's peculiar vein. This is translated from
the original by Mr. J. H. Harrison:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A certain vanquisher of women's hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While still his first wife was alive and well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Married a second, and a third. They tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king the scandal of such shameless arts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as his majesty abhorred all vice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Given himself to self-denial,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He gave the order in a trice<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To bring the bigamist to trial,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such a punishment invent, that none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should evermore dare do what he had done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And if the punishment to me should seem too small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around their table will I hang the judges all."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This to the judges seemed no joke:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The cold sweat ran along each spine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three days and nights they sit, but can't divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What punishment will best such lawless license choke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands of punishments there are; but then,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As all men of experience know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cannot keep from evil evil men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This time kind Providence did help them though,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the culprit came before the court,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This was his sentence short:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give him back his three wives all together.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The people wondered much at this decision,<br /></span>

<small>OTHER AND OCCASIONAL FABULISTS.</small></h2>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Not such as books, but such as Nature taught.'<br /></span>
</div><p class="aut"><span class="smcap">Waller.</span></p></div>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">Sir Roger L'Estrange</span> (1616-1704)
was a rabid Jacobite, journalist, and
pamphleteer, and during a long life spent in
fierce political conflict, in which, at times, he
bore a far from estimable part, found time to
translate various classical works, amongst these
being &AElig;sop's fables. L'Estrange's version (1692)
of the sage is not in the best taste. It is disfigured
by mannerisms and vulgarisms in language,
and the applications which he appended to
the fables are often a distortion of the true intent
of the apologue, stated so as to support and enforce
his own peculiar views in politics and religion.</p>

<p>Steele (1672-1729) was the author of at least
one excellent fable,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> <i>The Mastiff and his Puppy</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
not unworthy to take a place beside those of the
Greek sage:</p>

<p>'It happened one day, as a stout and honest
mastiff (that guarded the village where he lived
against thieves and robbers) was very gravely
walking with one of his puppies by his side, all
the little dogs in the street gathered round him,
and barked at him. The little puppy was so
offended at this affront done to his sire, that he
asked him why he would not fall upon them, and
tear them to pieces. To which the sire answered
with great composure of mind, "If there were no
curs, I should be no mastiff."'</p>

<p>Of other fabulists, it will be sufficient, without
going into lengthy particulars, to name Allan
Ramsay (1686-1758), who attempted the writing
of fables, though with but doubtful success; of
the thirty he produced there is not one of
striking merit. Edmund Arwaker, Rector of
Donaghmore, who compiled a collection of two
hundred and twenty-five select fables from &AElig;sop
and others, which he entitled, 'Truth in Fiction;
or, Morality in Masquerade' (1708). John Hall-Stevenson,
1718-1785 (the original of Sterne's
'Eugenius'), wrote 'Fables for Grown Gentlemen.'
Edward Moore composed a series of
original 'Fables for the Fair Sex' (1756), pleasing
in their versification, but otherwise of no striking
merit. Moore, besides a number of poems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
odes and songs, wrote two comedies ('The
Foundling' and 'Gil Blas') and a tragedy ('The
Gamester'), in which Garrick acted the leading
characters. He was also editor of the <i>World</i>, a
satirical journal of the period, which had a brief
life of four years. He died in poverty in 1751.
Francis Gentleman (actor and dramatist), whose
collection of 'Royal Fables' (1766) was dedicated
to George, Prince of Wales. William Wilkie,
D.D., a Scotch fabulist of some note in his day,
was Professor of Natural Philosophy in St.
Andrews University. In 1768 he published a
volume containing sixteen fables after the manner
of Gay. One of these, <i>The Boy and the Rainbow</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
a fable of considerable merit, has survived;
the others are forgotten. Rev. Henry Rowe,
whose fables tire without interesting. 'Fables
for Mankind,' by Charles Westmacott. 'The
Fables of Flora,' by Dr. Langhorne. Gaspey
wrote a number of original fables, as did also
Dr. Aitken and Walter Brown. Cowper, the
poet, penned some elegant fables with which
most readers are familiar. There are 'Fables for
Children, Young and Old, in Humorous Verse,'
by W. E. Staite (1830); Sheridan Wilson was
the author of a volume entitled 'The Bath Fables'
(1850); finally, there is Frere's Fables for 'Five
Years Old.' &AElig;sop's fables have been parodied
and caricatured, with varying success, by different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
writers, notably by an American author, under the
pseudonym of 'G. Washington &AElig;sop.'</p>

<p>Of lady fabulists, the most notable is Maria de
France, who lived in the first half of the thirteenth
century, and made a collection of one hundred
and six fables in French, which, she alleges, were
translated from the English of King Alfred.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
There are several more modern collections by
members of the fair sex. One is entitled 'The
Enchanted Plants, Fables in Verse;' London,
1800. The name of the author is not given, but
evidently a lady. Mrs. Trimmer has her version
of &AElig;sop. A volume of original fables was
published by Mary Maria Colling, a writer of
humble rank, under the patronage of the once
celebrated Mrs. Bray (daughter of Thomas Stothard,
R.A.), and Southey, the Poet Laureate. A
volume of fables, also original, by Mrs. Prosser,
and '&AElig;sop's Fables in Words of One Syllable,'
by Mary Godolphin.</p>

<p>Besides the fabulists already named, there are,
among the ancients, Avian, Ademar, Rufus,
Romulus, Alfonso and Poggio. Among the
French, Nivernois, and the Abb&eacute; F&eacute;nelon (1651-1715),
author of 'Dialogues of the Dead' and
'Telemachus.' Notwithstanding his reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in his own country as a fabulist, it must be
allowed that his fables are much too lengthy and
prolix. The characters he gives to his animals are
unnatural, and their manners and speech pointless
and tame. Florian, an imitator of Yriarte,
and a friend of Voltaire, by whose advice he cultivated
the literature of Spain; Boursalt, Boisard,
Ginguene, Jauffret, Le Grand and Armoult.
Amongst the Germans are, Gellert (1746), Nicolai,
Hagedorn, Pfeffel and Lichtner. The Italian
fabulists are numerous: Tommaso Crudeli
(1703-1743), Gian-Carlo Passeroni (1713-1803),
Giambattisti Roberti (1719-1786), Luigi Grillo
(1725-1790), Lorenzo Pignotti (1739-1812), who
with an elegant diction combines splendid descriptive
powers; Clemente Bondi (1742-1821), Aurelio
de Giorgi Bertola (1753-1798), Luigi Clasio (1754-1825),
Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi (1754-1827),
Gaetano Perego (1814-1868) and Gaetano Polidori.
Among Spanish fabulists, besides Yriarte, there is
Samaniego (1745-1801). Of Russian writers of
fables we have already spoken of Krilof, and there
are besides, Chemnitzer, Dmitriev, Glinka, Lomonosov
(1711-1765), Goncharov and Alexander
Sumarakov (1718-1777). Of English writers not
already referred to, the following may be named as
having tried their hand at the composition of
fables: Addison, Sir John Vanbrugh,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Prior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Goldsmith, Henryson, Coyne, Winter. Thomas
Percival, M.D., President of the Literary and
Philosophical Society of Manchester about the
end of last century, wrote a volume of moral
tales, fables, and reflections. Bussey's collection
is well known. The late W. J. Macquorn Rankine,
Regius Professor of Civil Engineering in Glasgow
University, wrote a number of 'Songs and
Fables,' which were published posthumously in
a small volume in 1874. The fables, twelve in
all, are an ingenious attempt, not wanting in
playful humour, to elucidate the origin and meaning
of some of the old and well-known signboards,
such as <i>The Pig and Whistle</i>, <i>The Cat and Fiddle</i>,
<i>The Goat and Compasses</i>, and others. An interesting
collection of one hundred and six 'Indian
Fables,' in English, the materials for which were
gathered from native sources and put into form
by Mr. P. V. Ramaswami Raju, B.A., were
originally contributed to the columns of the
<i>Leisure Hour</i>, and afterwards published in a
volume (1887).<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Specimens of the work of some of the writers
named are given in the succeeding pages.</p>

<p><i>The Bee and the Coquette</i> (Florian).&mdash;'Chloe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
young, handsome, and a decided coquette, laboured
very hard every morning on rising; people say it
was at her toilet; and there, smiling and smirking,
she related to her dear confidant all her pains,
her pleasures, and the projects of her soul.</p>

<p>'A thoughtless bee, entering her chamber,
began buzzing about. "Help! help!" immediately
shrieked the lady. "Lizzy! Mary! here, make
haste! drive away this winged monster!"</p>

<p>'The insolent insect settling on Chloe's lips,
she fainted; and Mary, furiously seizing the bee,
prepared to crush it.</p>

<p>'"Alas!" gently exclaimed the unfortunate
insect, "forgive my error; Chloe's mouth seemed
to me a rose, and as such I kissed it."</p>

<p>'This speech restored Chloe to her senses:
"Let us forgive it," said she, "on account of its
candid confession! Besides, its sting is but a
trifle; since it has spoken to you, I have scarcely
felt it."</p>

<p>'What may one not effect by a little well-timed
flattery?'</p>

<h3><i>The Farmer, Horseman, and Pedestrian</i> (Nivernois).</h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A farmer on his ass astride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who peacefully pursued his ride,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A horseman pass'd with lively speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, charming seat! what deed of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should thus incense the powers divine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Up which a poor, o'er-labour'd drudge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On tottering feet, was forc'd to trudge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With forehead prone, and bending back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press'd by a large and heavy pack.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The farmer cross'd the hill at ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jocosely set, with lolling knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his poor ass, the rugged scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appear'd a soft and level green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No flinty points his feet annoy'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pass'd the panting walker's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet saw him not, so rapt his brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dreams of Andalusia's plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such is the world&mdash;our bosoms brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With keen desire o'er others' good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this we muse, and, musing still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We rarely dream of others' ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A further truth the tale unfolds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each, like the ass-born hind, beholds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich around on steeds of Spain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deems their rank exempt from pain.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On those who clamber up the steep.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>The Land of the Halt</i> (Gellert).&mdash;'Many years
since, in a small territory, there was not one of the
inhabitants who did not stutter when he spoke,
and halt in walking; both these defects, moreover,
were considered accomplishments. A stranger
saw the evil, and, thinking how they would admire
his walking, went about without halting, after
the usual manner of our race. Everyone stopped
to look at him, and all those who looked, laughed,
and, holding their sides to repress their merriment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
shouted: "Teach the stranger how to walk
properly!"</p>

<p>'The stranger considered it his duty to cast the
reproach from himself. "You halt," he cried, "it
is not I; you must accustom yourselves to leave
off so awkward a habit!" This only increased the
uproar, when they heard him speak; he did not
even stammer; this was sufficient to disgrace
him, and he was laughed at throughout the
country.</p>

<p>'Habit will render faults, which we have been
accustomed to regard from youth, beautiful; in
vain will a stranger attempt to convince us that
we are in error. We look upon him as a madman,
solely because he is wiser than ourselves.'</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe how a true poet,
Cowper, treats the same subject, the object or
moral of the fable, however, being different:</p>

<h3><i>The Nightingale and Glow-worm.</i></h3>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A nightingale, that all day long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had cheer'd the village with his song,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Began to feel, as well he might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The keen demands of appetite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, looking eagerly around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spied far off, upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A something shining in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew the glow-worm by his spark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, stooping down from hawthorn top,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thought to put him in his crop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worm, aware of his intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harangued him thus, right eloquent:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Did you admire my lamp," quoth he,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The songster heard his short oration,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, warbling out his approbation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Released him&mdash;as my story tells&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And found a supper somewhere else.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till life's poor transient night is spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respecting in each other's case<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gifts of nature and of grace.<br /></span>

<p>Professor Rankine evidently took &AElig;sop's illustration
of 'The Bow Unbent' to heart, when,
relaxing his severer studies, he occupied occasional
hours in composing 'Songs and Fables.' The
three following pieces are examples of his work
as a fabulist, and of his skill in interpreting the
meaning of popular signs:</p>

<p>'<i>The Magpie and Stump.</i>&mdash;A magpie was in the
habit of depositing articles which he pilfered in the
hollow stump of a tree. "I grieve less," the stump
was heard to say, "at the misfortune of losing
my branches and leaves, than at the disgrace of
being made a receptacle for stolen goods." Moral:
<i>Infamy is harder to bear than adverse fortune</i>.'</p>

<p>'<i>The Green Man.</i>&mdash;A green man, wandering
through the Highlands of Scotland, discovered, in
a sequestered valley, a still, with which certain
unprincipled individuals were engaged in the illicit
manufacture of aqua-vit&aelig;. Being, as we have
stated, a green man, he was easily persuaded by
those unprincipled individuals to expend a considerable
sum in the purchase of the intoxicating
produce of their still, and to drink so much of it
that he speedily became insensible. On awaking
next morning, with an empty purse and an
aching head, he thought, with sorrow and shame,
what a green man he had been. Moral: <i>He
who follows the advice of unprincipled individuals
is a green man indeed</i>.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>The Bull and Mouth.</i>&mdash;A native of the Sister
Isle having opened his mouth during a convivial
entertainment, out flew a bull, whereupon some
of the company manifested alarm. "Calm your
fears," said the sagacious host; "verbal bulls
have no horns." Moral: <i>Harmless blunders are
subjects of amusement rather than of consternation</i>.'</p>

<p>The following curious 'Birth Story,' from the
collection of Indian Fables by Mr. P. V. Ramaswami
Raju, is an ironical commentary on the
doctrine of transmigration, in which the followers
of Buddha implicitly believe:</p>

<p>'One day a king in the far East was seated in
the hall of justice. A thief was brought before
him; he inquired into his case, and said he should
receive one hundred lashes with a cat-o'-nine-tails.
Instantly he recollected an old Eastern
saying, "What we do to others in this birth, they
will do to us in the next," and said to his minister,
"I have a great mind to let this thief go quietly,
for he is sure to give me these one hundred lashes in
the next birth." "Sire," replied the minister, "I
know the saying you refer to is perfectly true, but
you must understand you are simply returning to
the thief in this birth what he gave you in the
last." The king was perfectly pleased with this
reply, says the story, and gave his minister a rich
present.'</p>

<p>This selection of fables may be suitably concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
by two which, though not original, we
have not met with in print. The first is entitled
<i>The Nightingale, the Cuckoo and the Ass</i>:<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>'The nightingale and the cuckoo disputed as to
which of them was the best singer, and they
chose the ass to be the judge. First, the
nightingale poured forth one of his most entrancing
lays, followed by the cuckoo, with his
two mellow notes. Being requested to deliver
judgment, said the ass, "Without doubt the trill
of the nightingale is worth listening to; but for
a good plain song give me that of the cuckoo!"'</p>

<p>The moral here is obvious. Persons with a
want of taste, or with a depraved taste, see no
difference between things excellent and mean.
Nay, they will often be found to prefer the mean,
as being more in harmony with their own predilections.</p>

<p>The next is the shortest fable on record; its
humour is as conspicuous as its brevity, and it
hails from the County Palatine of Lancashire.
It is named The <i>Flea and the Elephant</i>:</p>

<p>'Passing into the ark together, said the flea to
its big brother: "Now, then, mister! no thrutching!"</p>

<p>'Moral: Insignificance has often its full share
of self-importance.'</p>

<p class="capd noin p2"><span class="dcap">Pictures</span> illustrating fables are a feature
that tends to enhance their attractiveness
and value, and the ablest artists have employed
their pencils in the work. It is sufficient to mention
Bewick and his pupils, whose illustrations
are greatly prized. S. Howitt's etchings of
animals in illustration of the fabulists (1811).
Northcote's original volumes (1828-33) are illustrated
with 560 charming engravings from the
author's designs. Robert Cruikshank illustrated
the 'Fables for Mankind,' by Charles Westmacott
(1823). Blake, Stothard, Harvey, and
Sir John Tenniel, the distinguished <i>Punch</i>
artist, have gained applause in the same field.
The latter illustrated a small volume of &AElig;sop
published by Murray in 1848. This is 'A New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Version of the Old Fables, chiefly from Original
Sources,' by the Rev. Thomas James, M.A., and
contains an introduction which is worthy of
perusal by those interested in the subject. The
first edition of the work is a rarity sought for by
collectors. Randolph Caldecott illustrated some
of &AElig;sop's fables in his own inimitable style.
Walter Crane<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and Harrison Weir<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> have exercised
their talents in the same direction, and
Mrs. Hugh Blackburn has supplied clever illustrations
to Rankine's fables. The pictures in the
collection of fables made by G. Moir Bussey
(1842) are from designs by J. J. Grandville,
and are full of originality and humour. The same
volume also contains an excellent 'Dissertation
on the History of Fable.' The spirited and
masterly designs of Oudry in illustration of La
Fontaine are justly prized and highly valued.
Gustave Dor&eacute; also employed his facile pencil in
illustrating the same author.</p>

<p>There are books bearing the title of 'Fables'
the contents of which are not fables in the restricted
sense. Of these are Dryden's so-called
fables, which are really metrical romances. A
competent critic has pronounced them to be the
'noblest specimens of versification to be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in any modern language,' but we need not speak
further of them in this connection. Again, there
is Bernard Mandeville's eccentric work, entitled
'The Fable of the Bees; or, Private Vices Public
Benefits.' This is an apologue in rhyme, with a
moral in addition, and followed by a voluminous
prose disquisition on questions of morality, partaking
of all the audacious paradoxical elements
which characterized its ingenious author. Thomas
Moore, the distinguished Irish poet, wrote a series
of eight political fables, which were originally
published by him under the pseudonym of
'Thomas Brown.' Neither these nor that of
Mandeville, however, are fables from our point of
view. The same remark applies to Lowell's well-known
'Fable for Critics,' and Lord Lytton's
'Fables in Song,' on which it is unnecessary to
dwell.</p>

<p>And so, having taken our survey of the fabulist
and his work, we conclude, as we rightly may,
that he is both philosopher and poet, but more
poet than philosopher, inasmuch as the imaginative
faculty is greatly at his command. Further,
as saith Sir Philip Sidney,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> 'The philosopher
teacheth, but he teacheth obscurely, so as the
learned only can understand him; that is to say,
he teacheth them that are already taught. But
the poet is the food for the tenderest stomachs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the poet is, indeed, the right popular philosopher.
Whereof &AElig;sop's tales give good proof; whose
pretty allegories, stealing under the formal tales
of beasts, make many, more beastly than beasts,
begin to hear the sound of virtue from these dumb
speakers.'</p>
